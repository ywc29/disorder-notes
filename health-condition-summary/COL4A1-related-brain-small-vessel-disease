text/html/html:p(1): <i>COL4A1</i>-related brain small-vessel disease is part of a group of conditions called the <i>COL4A1</i>-related disorders. The conditions in this group have a range of signs and symptoms that involve fragile blood vessels. <i>COL4A1</i>-related brain small-vessel disease is characterized by weakening of the blood vessels in the brain. Stroke is often the first symptom of this condition, typically occurring in mid-adulthood. In affected individuals, stroke is usually caused by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) rather than a lack of blood flow in the brain (ischemic stroke), although either type can occur. Individuals with this condition are at increased risk of having more than one stroke in their lifetime. People with <i>COL4A1</i>-related brain small vessel disease also have leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Affected individuals may also experience seizures and migraine headaches accompanied by visual sensations known as auras.
text/html/html:p(2): Some people with <i>COL4A1</i>-related brain small-vessel disease have an eye abnormality called Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly. Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly involves underdevelopment and eventual tearing of the colored part of the eye (iris) and a pupil that is not in the center of the eye. Other eye problems experienced by people with <i>COL4A1</i>-related brain small-vessel disease include clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract) and the presence of arteries that twist and turn abnormally within the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (arterial retinal tortuosity). Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly and cataract can cause impaired vision. Arterial retinal tortuosity can cause episodes of bleeding within the eye following any minor trauma to the eye, leading to temporary vision loss.
text/html/html:p(3): The severity of the condition varies greatly among affected individuals. Some individuals with <i>COL4A1</i>-related brain small-vessel disease do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition.
