text/text-role: description
text/html: <p><i>PPP2R5D</i>-related intellectual disability is a neurological disorder characterized by moderate to severe developmental delay and intellectual disability. Affected individuals have weak muscle tone (hypotonia); delayed development of motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking; and delayed speech development. Recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communications and social interaction, can also occur in affected individuals. Most people with <i>PPP2R5D</i>-related intellectual disability have an unusually large head size (macrocephaly), and some have other unusual facial features, including a prominent forehead (frontal bossing), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and eyes that slant downward (downslanting palpebral fissures).</p>
