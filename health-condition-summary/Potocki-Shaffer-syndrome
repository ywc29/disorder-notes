text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Potocki-Shaffer syndrome is a disorder that affects development of the bones, nerve cells in the brain, and other tissues. Most people with this condition have multiple noncancerous (benign) bone tumors called osteochondromas. In rare instances, these tumors become cancerous. People with Potocki-Shaffer syndrome also have enlarged openings in the two bones that make up much of the top and sides of the skull (enlarged parietal foramina). These abnormal openings form extra "soft spots" on the head, in addition to the two that newborns normally have. Unlike the usual newborn soft spots, the enlarged parietal foramina remain open throughout life.</p><p>The signs and symptoms of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome vary widely. In addition to multiple osteochondromas and enlarged parietal foramina, affected individuals often have intellectual disability and delayed development of speech, motor skills (such as sitting and walking), and social skills. Many people with this condition have distinctive facial features, which can include a wide, short skull (brachycephaly); a prominent forehead; a narrow bridge of the nose; a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum); and a downturned mouth. Less commonly, Potocki-Shaffer syndrome causes vision problems, additional skeletal abnormalities, and defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract.</p>
