text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia is a condition characterized by short stature, kidney disease, and a weakened immune system.  In people with this condition, short stature is caused by flattened spinal bones (vertebrae), resulting in a shortened neck and trunk.   Adult height is typically between 3 and 5 feet.  Kidney (renal) disease often leads to life-threatening renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).   Affected individuals also have a shortage of certain immune system cells called T cells.  T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection.  A shortage of T cells causes a person to be more susceptible to illness.
text/html/html:p(2): Other features frequently seen in people with this condition include an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (lordosis); darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation), typically on the chest and back; and a broad nasal bridge with a rounded tip of the nose.
text/html/html:p(3): Less common signs and symptoms of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia include an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis), reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia), migraine-like headaches, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), decreased numbers of white blood cells (lymphopenia), underdeveloped hip bones (hypoplastic pelvis), abnormally small head size (microcephaly), a lack of sperm (azoospermia) in males, and irregular menstruation in females.
text/html/html:p(4): In severe cases, many signs of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia can be present at birth. People with mild cases of this disorder may not develop signs or symptoms until late childhood.
