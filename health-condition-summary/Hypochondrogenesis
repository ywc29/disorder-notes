text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Hypochondrogenesis is a rare, severe disorder of bone growth.  This condition is characterized by a small body, short limbs, and abnormal bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis.
text/html/html:p(2): Affected infants have short arms and legs, a small chest with short ribs, and underdeveloped lungs.  Bones in the skull develop normally, but the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and pelvis do not harden (ossify) properly.   The face appears flat and oval-shaped, with widely spaced eyes, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate.  Individuals with hypochondrogenesis have an enlarged abdomen and may have a condition called hydrops fetalis in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth.
text/html/html:p(3): As a result of these serious health problems, some affected fetuses do not survive to term.  Infants born with hypochondrogenesis usually die at birth or shortly thereafter from respiratory failure.  Babies who live past the newborn period are usually reclassified as having spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a related but milder disorder that similarly affects bone development.
