text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Aspartylglucosaminuria is a condition that causes a progressive decline in mental functioning.
text/html/html:p(2): Infants with aspartylglucosaminuria appear healthy at birth, and development is typically normal throughout early childhood.  The first sign of this condition, evident around the age of 2 or 3, is usually delayed speech.  Mild intellectual disability then becomes apparent, and learning occurs at a slowed pace.  Intellectual disability progressively worsens in adolescence.   Most people with this disorder lose much of the speech they have learned, and affected adults usually have only a few words in their vocabulary.  Adults with aspartylglucosaminuria may develop seizures or problems with movement.
text/html/html:p(3): People with this condition may also have bones that become progressively weak and prone to fracture (osteoporosis), an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), and loose skin.  Affected individuals tend to have a characteristic facial appearance that includes widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), small ears, and full lips.  The nose is short and broad and the face is usually square-shaped.  Children with this condition may be tall for their age, but lack of a growth spurt in puberty typically causes adults to be short.  Affected children also tend to have frequent upper respiratory infections.  Individuals with aspartylglucosaminuria usually survive into mid-adulthood.
