text/html: <p>Aniridia is an eye disorder characterized by a complete or partial absence of the colored part of the eye (the iris).  These iris abnormalities may cause the pupils to be abnormal or misshapen.  Aniridia can cause reduction in the sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).</p><p>People with aniridia can also have other eye problems.   Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) typically appears in late childhood or early adolescence.  Clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts), occur in 50 percent to 85 percent of people with aniridia.  In about 10 percent of affected people, the structures that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves) are underdeveloped.  Individuals with aniridia may also have involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) or underdevelopment of the region at the back of the eye responsible for sharp central vision (foveal hypoplasia). Many of these eye problems contribute to progressive vision loss in affected individuals.  The severity of symptoms is typically the same in both eyes.</p><p>Rarely, people with aniridia have behavioral problems, developmental delay, and problems detecting odors.</p>
