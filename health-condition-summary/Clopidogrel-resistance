text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Clopidogrel resistance is a condition in which the drug clopidogrel is less effective than normal in people who are treated with it. Clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) is an antiplatelet drug, which means that it prevents blood cell fragments called platelets from sticking together (aggregating) and forming blood clots. This drug is typically given to prevent blood clot formation in individuals with a history of stroke; heart attack; a blood clot in the deep veins of the arms or legs (deep vein thrombosis); or plaque buildup (atherosclerosis) in the blood vessels leading from the heart, which are opened by placement of a small thin tube (stent).
text/html/html:p(2): People with clopidogrel resistance who receive clopidogrel are at risk of serious, sometimes fatal, complications. These individuals may have another heart attack or stroke caused by abnormal blood clot formation; those with stents can develop blood clots (thromboses) within the stents, impeding blood flow.
text/html/html:p(3): People with clopidogrel resistance can be divided into two categories: intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers. Intermediate metabolizers are able to process some clopidogrel, so they receive partial benefit from the treatment but are not protected from developing a harmful blood clot. Poor metabolizers process little or no clopidogrel, so they receive very limited benefit from the treatment and are at risk of forming a harmful blood clot.
text/html/html:p(4): Clopidogrel resistance does not appear to cause any health problems other than those associated with clopidogrel drug treatment.
