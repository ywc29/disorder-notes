text/text-role: description
text/html: <p><i>ALG6</i>-congenital disorder of glycosylation (<i>ALG6</i>-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ic) is an inherited condition that affects many parts of the body. The signs and symptoms of <i>ALG6</i>-CDG vary widely among people with the condition.</p><p>Individuals with <i>ALG6</i>-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy. They may have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Affected infants often have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and developmental delay.</p><p>People with <i>ALG6</i>-CDG may have seizures, problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), or stroke-like episodes that involve an extreme lack of energy (lethargy) and temporary paralysis. They may also develop blood clotting disorders. Some individuals with <i>ALG6</i>-CDG have eye abnormalities including eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, which causes vision loss. Females with <i>ALG6</i>-CDG have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual development. As a result, most females with <i>ALG6</i>-CDG do not go through puberty.</p>
