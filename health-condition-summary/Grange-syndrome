text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Grange syndrome is a rare condition that primarily affects the blood vessels. It is characterized by narrowing (stenosis) or blockage (occlusion) of arteries that supply blood to various organs and tissues, including the kidneys, brain, and heart. Stenosis or occlusion of the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys (renal arteries) can result in chronic high blood pressure (hypertension). Blockage of the arteries that carry blood to the brain (cerebral arteries) can cause a stroke.
text/html/html:p(2): Additional features of Grange syndrome can include short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), fusion of some of the fingers or toes (syndactyly), fragile bones that are prone to breakage, and learning disabilities. Most people with this disorder also have heart defects that are present from birth.
