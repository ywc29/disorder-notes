text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency (also known as HMG-CoA lyase deficiency) is an uncommon inherited disorder in which the body cannot process a particular protein building block (amino acid) called leucine.  Additionally, the disorder prevents the body from making ketones, which are compounds that are used for energy during periods without food (fasting).</p><p>The signs and symptoms of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency usually appear within the first year of life. The condition causes episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia).  During an episode, blood sugar levels can become dangerously low (hypoglycemia), and a buildup of harmful compounds can cause the blood to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis).  If untreated, the disorder can lead to breathing problems, convulsions, coma, and death.  Episodes are often triggered by an infection, fasting, strenuous exercise, or other types of stress.</p><p>HMG-CoA lyase deficiency is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe  disorder that develops in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.</p>
