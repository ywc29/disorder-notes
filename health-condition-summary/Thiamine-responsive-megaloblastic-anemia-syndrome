text/html/html:p(1): Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome is a rare condition characterized by hearing loss, diabetes, and a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than normal (megaloblastic). The symptoms of this blood disorder may include decreased appetite, lack of energy, headaches, pale skin, diarrhea, and tingling or numbness in the hands and feet. Individuals with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome begin to show symptoms of megaloblastic anemia between infancy and adolescence. This syndrome is called "thiamine-responsive" because the anemia can be treated with high doses of vitamin B1 (thiamine).
text/html/html:p(2): People with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) during early childhood. It remains unclear whether thiamine treatment can improve hearing or prevent hearing loss.
text/html/html:p(3): Diabetes becomes apparent in affected individuals sometime between infancy and adolescence. Although these individuals develop diabetes during childhood, they do not have the form of the disease that develops most often in children, called type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes. People with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome usually require insulin to treat their diabetes. In some cases, treatment with thiamine can reduce the amount of insulin a person needs.
text/html/html:p(4): Some individuals with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome develop optic atrophy, which is the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain. Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems such as heart rhythm abnormalities and heart defects have also been reported in some people with this syndrome.
