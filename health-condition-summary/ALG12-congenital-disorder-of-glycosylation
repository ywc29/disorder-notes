text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): <i>ALG12</i>-congenital disorder of glycosylation (<i>ALG12</i>-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ig) is an inherited disorder with varying signs and symptoms that can affect several body systems. Individuals with <i>ALG12</i>-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy. They may have problems feeding and difficulty growing and gaining weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). In addition, affected individuals often have intellectual disability, delayed development, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and some develop seizures.
text/html/html:p(2): Some people with <i>ALG12</i>-CDG have physical abnormalities such as a small head size (microcephaly) and unusual facial features. These features can include folds of skin that cover the inner corners of the eyes (epicanthal folds), a prominent nasal bridge, and abnormally shaped ears. Some males with <i>ALG12</i>-CDG have abnormal genitalia, such as a small penis (micropenis) and undescended testes.
text/html/html:p(3): People with <i>ALG12</i>-CDG often produce abnormally low levels of proteins called antibodies (or immunoglobulins), particularly immunoglobulin G (IgG). Antibodies help protect the body against infection by attaching to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. A reduction in antibodies can make it difficult for affected individuals to fight infections.
text/html/html:p(4): Less common abnormalities seen in people with <i>ALG12</i>-CDG include a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) and poor bone development, which can lead to skeletal abnormalities.
