text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL) is a rare condition that primarily affects the brain, eyes, and skin of the head and face. Most of this condition's signs and symptoms are present from birth, and they vary widely among affected individuals.
text/html/html:p(2): A hallmark feature of ECCL is a noncancerous tumor under the scalp covered by a smooth, hairless patch of skin. This type of tumor, called a nevus psiloliparus, is made up of fatty tissue. Some people with ECCL also have noncancerous tumors under the skin elsewhere on the head or face. Many have small flaps of skin called skin tags on the eyelids and around the eyes. Hair loss (alopecia), thin or missing patches of skin on the scalp (dermal hypoplasia or aplasia), and changes in skin coloring (pigmentation) are also possible.
text/html/html:p(3): The most common eye abnormality in ECCL is a noncancerous growth called a choristoma. These growths can be present in one or both eyes and may affect vision.
text/html/html:p(4): About two-thirds of people with ECCL have noncancerous fatty tumors inside the brain or around the spinal cord. These tumors are called intracranial lipomas and intraspinal lipomas, respectively. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing a type of brain cancer called a glioma. The brain and spinal cord abnormalities associated with ECCL can cause seizures, abnormal tensing of the muscles, and intellectual disability ranging from mild to profound. However, about one-third of affected individuals have normal intelligence.
text/html/html:p(5): Other kinds of growths may also occur in people with ECCL, including noncancerous jaw tumors.
