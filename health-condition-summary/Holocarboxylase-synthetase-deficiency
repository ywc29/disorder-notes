text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to use the vitamin biotin effectively.  This disorder is classified as a multiple carboxylase deficiency, a group of disorders characterized by impaired activity of certain enzymes that depend on biotin.
text/html/html:p(2): The signs and symptoms of holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency typically appear within the first few months of life, but the age of onset varies.  Affected infants often have difficulty feeding, breathing problems, a skin rash, hair loss (alopecia), and a lack of energy (lethargy).  Immediate treatment and lifelong management with biotin supplements may prevent many of these complications.  If left untreated, the disorder can lead to delayed development, seizures, and coma.  These medical problems may be life-threatening in some cases.
