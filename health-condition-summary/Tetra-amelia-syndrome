text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Tetra-amelia syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by the absence of all four limbs.  ("Tetra" is the Greek word for "four," and "amelia" refers to the failure of an arm or leg to develop before birth.)  This syndrome can also cause severe malformations of other parts of the body, including the face and head, heart, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia.  The lungs are underdeveloped in many cases, which makes breathing difficult or impossible.  Because children with tetra-amelia syndrome have such serious medical problems, most are stillborn or die shortly after birth.</p>
