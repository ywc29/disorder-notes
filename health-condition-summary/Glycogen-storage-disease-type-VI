text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Glycogen storage disease type VI (also known as GSDVI or Hers disease) is an inherited disorder caused by an inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen in liver cells. A lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the normal function of the liver.
text/html/html:p(2): The signs and symptoms of GSDVI typically begin in infancy to early childhood. The first sign is usually an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). During prolonged periods without food (fasting), affected individuals may have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or elevated levels of ketones in the blood (ketosis). Ketones are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats, which occurs when stored sugars are unavailable. Children with GSDVI tend to grow slower than their peers, but they often achieve normal height as adults. Some affected children also have mild delays in the development of motor skills, such as sitting, standing, or walking.
text/html/html:p(3): The signs and symptoms of GSDVI tend to improve with age; most adults with this condition do not have any related health problems.
