text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Timothy syndrome is a rare disorder that affects many parts of the body including the heart, digits (fingers and toes), and the nervous system.
text/html/html:p(2): Timothy syndrome is characterized by a heart condition called long QT syndrome, which causes the heart (cardiac) muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats.  This abnormality in the heart's electrical system can cause irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia), which can lead to sudden death.  Many people with Timothy syndrome are also born with structural heart defects that affect the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. As a result of these serious heart problems, many people with Timothy syndrome live only into childhood.  The most common cause of death is a form of arrhythmia called ventricular tachyarrhythmia, in which the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) beat abnormally fast and lead to cardiac arrest.
text/html/html:p(3): Timothy syndrome is also characterized by webbing or fusion of the skin between some fingers or toes (cutaneous syndactyly).  About half of affected people have distinctive facial features such as a flattened nasal bridge, low-set ears, a small upper jaw, and a thin upper lip.  Children with this condition have small, misplaced teeth and frequent cavities (dental caries).  Additional signs and symptoms of Timothy syndrome can include baldness at birth, frequent infections, episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia).
text/html/html:p(4): Researchers have found that many children with Timothy syndrome have the characteristic features of autism or similar conditions known as autistic spectrum disorders.  Affected children tend to have impaired communication and socialization skills, as well as delayed development of speech and language.  Other nervous system abnormalities, including intellectual disability and seizures, can also occur in children with Timothy syndrome.
text/html/html:p(5): Researchers have identified two forms of Timothy syndrome.  Type 1, which is also known as the classic type, includes all of the characteristic features described above. Type 2, or the atypical type, causes a more severe form of long QT syndrome and a greater risk of arrhythmia and sudden death.  Unlike the classic type, the atypical type does not appear to cause webbing of the fingers or toes.
