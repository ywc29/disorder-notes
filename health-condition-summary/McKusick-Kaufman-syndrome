text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>McKusick-Kaufman syndrome is a condition that affects the development of the hands and feet, heart, and reproductive system.  It is characterized by a combination of three features: extra fingers and/or toes (polydactyly), heart defects, and genital abnormalities.</p><p>Most females with McKusick-Kaufman syndrome are born with a genital abnormality called hydrometrocolpos, which is a large accumulation of fluid in the pelvis.  Hydrometrocolpos  results from a blockage of the vagina before birth, which can occur if part of the vagina fails to develop (vaginal agenesis) or if a membrane blocks the opening of the vagina.  This blockage allows fluid to build up in the vagina and uterus, stretching these organs and leading to a fluid-filled mass.  Genital abnormalities in males with McKusick-Kaufman syndrome can include placement of the urethral opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), a downward-curving penis (chordee), and undescended testes (cryptorchidism).</p><p>The signs and symptoms of McKusick-Kaufman syndrome overlap significantly with those of another genetic disorder, Bardet-Biedl syndrome.  Bardet-Biedl syndrome has several features that are not seen in McKusick-Kaufman syndrome, however.  These include vision loss, delayed development, obesity, and kidney (renal) failure.  Because some of these features are not apparent at birth, the two conditions can be difficult to tell apart in infancy and early childhood.</p>
