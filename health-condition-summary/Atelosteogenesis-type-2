text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Atelosteogenesis type 2 is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development.  Infants born with this condition have very short arms and legs, a narrow chest, and a prominent, rounded abdomen.  This disorder is also characterized by an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), distinctive facial features, an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot), and unusually positioned thumbs (hitchhiker thumbs).</p><p>The signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis type 2 are similar to those of another skeletal disorder called diastrophic dysplasia; however, atelosteogenesis type 2 is typically more severe.  As a result of serious health problems, infants with this disorder are usually stillborn or die soon after birth from respiratory failure. Some infants, however, have lived for a short time with intensive medical support.</p>
