text/html/html:p: Factor VII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that varies in severity among affected individuals. The signs and symptoms of this condition can begin at any age, although the most severe cases are apparent in infancy. However, up to one-third of people with factor VII deficiency never have any bleeding problems. Factor VII deficiency commonly causes nosebleeds (epistaxis), bleeding of the gums, easy bruising, and prolonged or excessive bleeding following surgery or physical injury. Bleeding into joint spaces (hemarthrosis) and blood in the urine (hematuria) occasionally occur. Many women with factor VII deficiency have heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). Severely affected individuals have an increased risk of bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) or in the gastrointestinal tract, which can be life-threatening. Although factor VII deficiency is primarily associated with increased bleeding, some people with the condition have excessive blood clotting (thrombosis).
