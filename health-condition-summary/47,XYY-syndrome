text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): 47,XYY syndrome is characterized by an extra copy of the Y chromosome in each of a male's cells. Although many males with this condition are taller than average, the chromosomal change sometimes causes no unusual physical features. Most males with 47,XYY syndrome have normal production of the male sex hormone testosterone and normal sexual development, and they are usually able to father children.
text/html/html:p(2): 47,XYY syndrome is associated with an increased risk of learning disabilities and delayed development of speech and language skills. Other possible signs and symptoms include delayed development of motor skills (such as sitting and walking), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), hand tremors or other involuntary movements (motor tics), seizures, asthma, flat feet (pes planus), fifth fingers that curve inward (clinodactyly) and abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). These characteristics vary widely among affected boys and men.
text/html/html:p(3): Males with 47,XYY syndrome have an increased risk of behavioral, social, and emotional difficulties compared with their unaffected peers. These problems include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); depression; anxiety; and autism spectrum disorder, which is a group of developmental conditions that affect communication and social interaction.
