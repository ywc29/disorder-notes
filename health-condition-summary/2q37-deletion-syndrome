text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): 2q37 deletion syndrome is a condition that can affect many parts of the body.   This condition is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy, mild to severe intellectual disability and developmental delay, behavioral problems, characteristic facial features, and other physical abnormalities.
text/html/html:p(2): Most babies with 2q37 deletion syndrome are born with hypotonia, which usually improves with age.  About 25 percent of people with this condition have autism, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.
text/html/html:p(3): The characteristic facial features associated with 2q37 deletion syndrome include a prominent forehead, highly arched eyebrows, deep-set eyes, a flat nasal bridge, a thin upper lip, and minor ear abnormalities.  Other features of this condition can include short stature, obesity, unusually short fingers and toes (brachymetaphalangy), sparse hair, heart defects, seizures,  and an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema.  A few people with 2q37 deletion syndrome have a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor. Some affected individuals have malformations of the brain, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia.
