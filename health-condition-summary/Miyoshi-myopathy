text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Miyoshi myopathy is a muscle disorder that begins with weakness in the muscles that are located away from the center of the body (distal muscles), such as those in the legs. During early to mid-adulthood, affected individuals typically begin to experience muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) in one or both calves. If only one leg is affected, the calves appear different in size (asymmetrical). Calf weakness can make it difficult to stand on tiptoe.</p><p>As Miyoshi myopathy slowly worsens, the muscle weakness and atrophy spread up the leg to the muscles in the thigh and buttock and can also involve the upper arm and shoulder muscles. Eventually, affected individuals may have difficulty climbing stairs or walking for an extended period of time. Some people with Miyoshi myopathy may eventually need wheelchair assistance.</p><p>Rarely, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) have developed in people with Miyoshi myopathy. Individuals with Miyoshi myopathy have highly elevated levels of an enzyme called creatine kinase (CK) in their blood, which often indicates muscle disease.</p>
