text/html: <p>Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a condition that affects blood cells and primarily occurs in males. A main feature of this condition is a type of anemia called dyserythropoietic anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells. The term "dyserythropoietic" refers to the abnormal red blood cell formation that occurs in this condition. In affected individuals, immature red blood cells are unusually shaped and cannot develop into functional mature cells, leading to a shortage of healthy red blood cells. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have another blood disorder characterized by a reduced level of circulating platelets (thrombocytopenia). Platelets are cell fragments that normally assist with blood clotting. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. While people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have signs and symptoms of both blood disorders, some are primarily affected by anemia, while others are more affected by thrombocytopenia.</p><p>The most severe cases of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. For many others, the signs and symptoms of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia begin in infancy. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or bruising after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, and fatigue. Severe anemia may create a need for frequent blood transfusions to replenish the supply of red blood cells; however, repeated blood transfusions over many years can cause health problems such as excess iron in the blood. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia may also have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to recurrent infections. Additionally, they may have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). The severity of these abnormalities varies among affected individuals.</p><p>Some people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia have additional blood disorders such as beta thalassemia or congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Beta thalassemia is a condition that reduces the production of hemoglobin, which is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A decrease in hemoglobin can lead to a shortage of oxygen in cells and tissues throughout the body. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is another disorder that impairs hemoglobin production. People with congenital erythropoietic porphyria are also very sensitive to sunlight, and areas of skin exposed to the sun can become fragile and blistered.</p>
