text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome is characterized by the absence of a bone called the radius in each forearm and a shortage (deficiency) of blood cell fragments involved in clotting (platelets). This platelet deficiency (thrombocytopenia) usually appears during infancy and becomes less severe over time; in some cases the platelet levels become normal.</p><p>Thrombocytopenia prevents normal blood clotting, resulting in easy bruising and frequent nosebleeds. Potentially life-threatening episodes of severe bleeding (hemorrhages) may occur in the brain and other organs, especially during the first year of life. Hemorrhages can damage the brain and lead to intellectual disability. Affected children who survive this period and do not have damaging hemorrhages in the brain usually have a normal life expectancy and normal intellectual development.</p><p>The severity of skeletal problems in TAR syndrome varies among affected individuals. The radius, which is the bone on the thumb side of the forearm, is almost always missing in both arms. The other bone in the forearm, which is called the ulna, is sometimes underdeveloped or absent in one or both arms. TAR syndrome is unusual among similar malformations in that affected individuals have thumbs, while people with other conditions involving an absent radius typically do not. However, there may be other abnormalities of the hands, such as webbed or fused fingers (syndactyly) or curved pinky fingers (fifth finger clinodactyly). Some people with TAR syndrome also have skeletal abnormalities affecting the upper arms, legs, or hip sockets.</p><p>Other features that can occur in TAR syndrome include malformations of the heart or kidneys. Some people with this disorder have unusual facial features including a small lower jaw (micrognathia), a prominent forehead, and low-set ears. About half of affected individuals have allergic reactions to cow's milk that may worsen the thrombocytopenia associated with this disorder.</p>
