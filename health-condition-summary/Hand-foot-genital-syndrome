text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p(1): Hand-foot-genital syndrome is a rare condition that affects the development of the hands and feet, the urinary tract, and the reproductive system.  People with this condition have abnormally short thumbs and first (big) toes, small fifth fingers that curve inward (clinodactyly), short feet, and fusion or delayed hardening of bones in the wrists and ankles.  The other bones in the arms and legs are normal.
text/html/html:p(2): Abnormalities of the genitals and urinary tract can vary among affected individuals.  Many people with hand-foot-genital syndrome have defects in the ureters, which are tubes that carry urine from each kidney to the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.  Recurrent urinary tract infections and an inability to control the flow of urine (urinary incontinence) have been reported.  About half of males with this disorder have the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias).
text/html/html:p(3): People with hand-foot-genital syndrome are usually able to have children (fertile).  In some affected females, problems in the early development of the uterus can later increase the risk of pregnancy loss, premature labor, and stillbirth.
