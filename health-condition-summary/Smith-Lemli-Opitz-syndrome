text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body.  This condition is characterized by distinctive facial features, small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability or learning problems, and behavioral problems.  Many affected children have the characteristic features of  autism, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.  Malformations of the heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and genitalia are also common.  Infants with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), experience feeding difficulties, and tend to grow more slowly than other infants.  Most affected individuals have fused second and third toes (syndactyly), and some have extra fingers or toes (polydactyly).</p><p>The signs and symptoms of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome vary widely.  Mildly affected individuals may have only minor physical abnormalities with learning and behavioral problems.  Severe cases can be life-threatening and involve profound intellectual disability and major physical abnormalities.</p>
