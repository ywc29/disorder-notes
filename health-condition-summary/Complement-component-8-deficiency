text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Complement component 8 deficiency is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria. People with complement component 8 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of recurrent bacterial infections, particularly by a bacterium called <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>. Infection by this bacterium causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Although meningitis can be life-threatening, individuals with complement component 8 deficiency are less likely to die from the infection than people in the general population who contract it.</p><p>The severity of complement component 8 deficiency varies widely. While some people with this condition experience one or more infections, others do not have any health problems related to the disorder.</p><p>There are two types of complement component 8 deficiency, types I and II, classified by their genetic cause. The two types have the same signs and symptoms.</p>
