text/text-role: description
text/html: <p>Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is a disorder that affects peripheral nerves. These nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells that detect touch, pain, and temperature. In people with this disorder, the peripheral nerves are unusually sensitive to pressure, such as the pressure that occurs when carrying heavy grocery bags, leaning on an elbow, or sitting without changing position, particularly with crossed legs. These activities would not normally cause sensation problems in people without the disorder.</p><p>Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands.</p><p>A pressure palsy episode results from pressure on a single nerve, and any peripheral nerve can be affected. Although episodes often recur, they can affect different nerves. The most common problem sites involve nerves in the wrists, elbows, and knees. The fingers, shoulders, hands, feet, and scalp can also be affected. Many people with this disorder experience carpal tunnel syndrome, which occurs when a nerve in the wrist (the median nerve) is involved. Carpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. An episode in the hand may affect fine motor activities such as writing, opening jars, and fastening buttons. An episode of nerve compression in the knee can lead to a condition called foot drop, which makes walking, climbing stairs, or driving difficult or impossible.</p><p>The symptoms of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies usually begin during adolescence or early adulthood but may develop anytime from childhood to late adulthood. Symptoms vary in severity; many people never realize they have the disorder, while some people experience prolonged disability. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies does not affect life expectancy.</p>
