text/html: <p>Familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated <i>CEBPA</i> is one form of a cancer of the blood-forming tissue (bone marrow) called acute myeloid leukemia. In normal bone marrow, early blood cells called hematopoietic stem cells develop into several types of blood cells: white blood cells (leukocytes) that protect the body from infection; red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen; and platelets (thrombocytes), which are cell fragments that are involved in blood clotting. In acute myeloid leukemia, the bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. Instead of developing into normal white blood cells, the myeloid blasts develop into cancerous leukemia cells. The large number of abnormal cells in the bone marrow interferes with the production of functional white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.</p><p>People with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated <i>CEBPA</i> have a shortage of white blood cells (leukopenia), leading to increased susceptibility to infections. A low number of red blood cells (anemia) also occurs in this disorder, resulting in fatigue and weakness. Affected individuals also have a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. Other symptoms of familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated <i>CEBPA</i> may include fever and weight loss.</p><p>While acute myeloid leukemia is generally a disease of older adults, familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated <i>CEBPA</i> often begins earlier in life, and it has been reported to occur as early as age 4. Between 50 and 65 percent of affected individuals survive their disease, compared with 25 to 40 percent of those with other forms of acute myeloid leukemia. However, people with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated <i>CEBPA</i> have a higher risk of having a new primary occurrence of this disorder after successful treatment of the initial occurrence.</p>
