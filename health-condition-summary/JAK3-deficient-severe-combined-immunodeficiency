text/text-role: description
text/html/html:p: <i>JAK3</i>-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is an inherited disorder of the immune system. Individuals with <i>JAK3</i>-deficient SCID lack the necessary immune cells to fight off certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with <i>JAK3</i>-deficient SCID are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people. Affected infants typically develop chronic diarrhea, a fungal infection in the mouth called oral thrush, pneumonia, and skin rashes. Persistent illness also causes affected individuals to grow more slowly than other children. Without treatment, people with <i>JAK3</i>-deficient SCID usually live only into early childhood.
