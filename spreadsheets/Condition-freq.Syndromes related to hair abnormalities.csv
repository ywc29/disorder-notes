Name,GHR-webpage,,Problems,,Genes
"Androgenetic alopecia",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgenetic-alopecia,,"hair loss","a common form of hair loss in both men and women. In men, this condition is also known as male-pattern baldness. Hair is lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Over time, the hairline recedes to form a characteristic ""M"" shape. Hair also thins at the crown (near the top of the head), often progressing to partial or complete baldness.The pattern of hair loss in women differs from male-pattern baldness. In women, the hair becomes thinner all over the head, and the hairline does not recede. Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness.Androgenetic alopecia in men has been associated with several other medical conditions including coronary heart disease and enlargement of the prostate. Additionally, prostate cancer, disorders of insulin resistance (such as diabetes and obesity), and high blood pressure (hypertension) have been related to androgenetic alopecia. In women, this form of hair loss is associated with an increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by a hormonal imbalance that can lead to irregular menstruation, acne, excess hair elsewhere on the body (hirsutism), and weight gain.","Although researchers suspect that several genes play a role in androgenetic alopecia, variations in only one gene, AR, have been confirmed in scientific studies."
"Atopic dermatitis",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/atopic-dermatitis,,"hair loss","Individuals with atopic dermatitis have an increased risk of developing other conditions related to inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hair loss caused by a malfunctioning immune reaction (alopecia areata). ","In very rare cases, atopic dermatitis is caused by inherited mutations in a single gene. One such gene is the CARD11 gene. Several common genetic variations may be involved, each contributing only a small amount to the risk of developing atopic dermatitis. The strongest of these associations is with the FLG gene, which is altered in 20 to 30 percent of people with atopic dermatitis compared with 8 to 10 percent of the general population without atopic dermatitis."
"Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal-dystrophy,,"hair loss","Additional features that occur in people with APECED, many of which can lead to permanent organ and tissue damage if left untreated, include stomach irritation (gastritis), liver inflammation (hepatitis), lung irritation (pneumonitis), dry mouth and dry eyes (Sjogren-like syndrome), inflammation of the eyes (keratitis), kidney problems (nephritis), vitamin B12 deficiency, hair loss (alopecia),","Mutations in the AIRE gene cause APECED. Th"
"Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autosomal-recessive-hypotrichosis,,"sparse hair, hair loss","Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis is a condition that affects hair growth. People with this condition have sparse hair (hypotrichosis) on the scalp beginning in infancy. Over time, the hair problems can remain stable or progress to complete scalp hair loss (alopecia) In Japan, the condition is estimated to affect 1 in 10,000 individuals.","Mutations in the LIPH, LPAR6, or DSG4 gene result in the production of abnormal proteins that cannot aid in the development of hair follicles. As a result, hair follicles are structurally abnormal and often underdeveloped. Irregular hair follicles alter the structure and growth of hair shafts, leading to woolly, fragile hair that is easily broken. "
"Biotinidase deficiency",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/biotinidase-deficiency,,"hair loss","Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to recycle the vitamin biotin. Profound biotinidase deficiency, the more severe form of the condition, can cause seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), breathing problems, hearing and vision loss, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), skin rashes, hair loss (alopecia), Partial biotinidase deficiency is a milder form of this condition. Without treatment, affected children may experience hypotonia, skin rashes, and hair loss, but these problems may appear only during illness, infection, or other times of stress.","Mutations in the BTD gene reduce or eliminate the activity of biotinidase. "
"Björnstad syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bjornstad-syndrome,,"hair grows slowly","The hair is brittle and breaks easily, leading to short hair that grows slowly. The proportion of hairs affected and the severity of brittleness and breakage can vary. This hair abnormality commonly begins before the age of 2. It may become milder with age, particularly after puberty.","Björnstad syndrome is caused by mutations in the BCS1L gene."
"Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cerebral-autosomal-recessive-arteriopathy-with-subcortical-infarcts-and-leukoencephalopathy,,"hair loss","Other characteristic features of CARASIL include premature hair loss (alopecia). The hair loss often begins during adolescence and is limited to the scalp.","In people with CARASIL, mutations in the HTRA1 gene prevent the effective regulation of TGF-β signaling. Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling may also underlie the hair loss in people with CARASIL, although the relationship between abnormal TGF-β signaling and these features is less clear."
"Clouston syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/clouston-syndrome,,"hair loss","In infants with Clouston syndrome, scalp hair is sparse, patchy, By puberty, the hair problems may worsen until all the hair on the scalp is lost (total alopecia).","Clouston syndrome is caused by mutations in the GJB6 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 6, more commonly known as connexin 30. GJB6 gene mutations that cause Clouston syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the connexin 30 protein. Although the effects of these mutations are not fully understood, they lead to abnormalities in the growth, division, and maturation of cells in the hair follicles, "
"Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/dihydropyrimidine-dehydrogenase-deficiency,,"hair loss","People with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, including those who otherwise exhibit no symptoms, are vulnerable to severe, potentially life-threatening toxic reactions to certain drugs called fluoropyrimidines that are used to treat cancer. Fluoropyrimidine toxicity may also lead to low numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), which increases the risk of infections. It can also be associated with low numbers of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia), which impairs blood clotting and may lead to abnormal bleeding (hemorrhage). Redness, swelling, numbness, and peeling of the skin on the palms and soles (hand-foot syndrome); shortness of breath; and hair loss may also occur.","Mutations in the DPYD gene result in a lack (deficiency) of functional dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Because fluoropyrimidine drugs are also broken down by the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzyme, deficiency of this enzyme leads to the drug buildup that causes fluoropyrimidine toxicity."
"Dyskeratosis congenita",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/dyskeratosis-congenita,,"hair loss, grey hair","People with dyskeratosis congenita may also develop pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scar tissue (fibrosis) to build up in the lungs, decreasing the transport of oxygen into the bloodstream. Additional signs and symptoms that occur in some people with dyskeratosis congenita include eye abnormalities such as narrow tear ducts that may become blocked, preventing drainage of tears and leading to eyelid irritation; dental problems; hair loss or prematurely grey hair;","In about half of people with dyskeratosis congenita, the disorder is caused by mutations in the TERT, TERC, DKC1, or TINF2 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that help maintain structures known as telomeres, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. In a small number of individuals with dyskeratosis congenita, mutations in other genes involved with telome, CTC1, DKC1, NHP2, NOP10, RTEL1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, WRAP53,re maintenance have been identified. "
"Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/encephalocraniocutaneous-lipomatosis,,"hair loss","A rare condition that primarily affects the brain, eyes, and skin of the head and face. Hair loss (alopecia) also possible.","The FGFR1 gene mutations that cause ECCL arise randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth. As cells continue to grow and divide, some cells will have the mutation and others will not. This mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism. In cells with an altered FGFR1 gene, the resulting FGFR1 protein is overactive, triggering abnormal signaling that affects cell growth and division. Researchers are studying how these changes in signaling lead to the growth of noncancerous tumors and the other features of ECCL."
"Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/epidermolysis-bullosa-with-pyloric-atresia,,"hair loss","Other complications of EB-PA can include fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia)","EB-PA can be caused by mutations in the ITGA6, ITGB4, and PLEC genes."
"Familial partial lipodystrophy",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-partial-lipodystrophy,,"excessive hair growth in female","a rare condition characterized by an abnormal distribution of fatty (adipose) tissue. After puberty, some affected females develop multiple cysts on the ovaries, an increased amount of body hair (hirsutism),","Familial partial lipodystrophy can be caused by mutations in several genes, ADRA2A, AKT2, CIDEC, LIPE, LMNA, PLIN1, PPARG. Type 2 results from mutations in the LMNA gene. The other, less common forms of the disorder are caused by mutations in different genes."
"Focal dermal hypoplasia",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/focal-dermal-hypoplasia,,"sparse hair","a genetic disorder that primarily affects the skin, skeleton, eyes, and face. About 90 percent of affected individuals are female. Males usually have milder signs and symptoms than females. Hair on the scalp can be sparse and brittle or absent.","Mutations in the PORCN gene appear to prevent the production of any functional PORCN protein. Researchers believe Wnt proteins cannot be released from the cell without the PORCN protein. When Wnt proteins are unable to leave the cell, they cannot participate in the chemical signaling pathways that are critical for normal development. The various signs and symptoms of focal dermal hypoplasia are likely due to abnormal Wnt signaling during early development."
"Frontonasal dysplasia",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/frontonasal-dysplasia,,"hair loss","There are at least three types of frontonasal dysplasia that are distinguished by their genetic causes and their signs and symptoms. Individuals with frontonasal dysplasia type 2 can have hair loss (alopecia)","ALX4 gene mutations cause type 2, "
"Griscelli syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/griscelli-syndrome,,"hypopigmented hair","Griscelli syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by unusually light (hypopigmented) skin and light silvery-gray hair starting in infancy","The three types of Griscelli syndrome are caused by mutations in different genes: Type 1 results from mutations in the MYO5A gene, type 2 is caused by mutations in the RAB27A gene, and type 3 results from mutations in the MLPH gene."
"Hajdu-Cheney syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hajdu-cheney-syndrome,,"excess body hair","A rare disorder that can affect many parts of the body, particularly the bones. Other features of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome found in some affected individuals include joint abnormalities, particularly an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility); dental problems; hearing loss; a deep, gravelly voice; excess body hair;","Mutations in a specific area near the end of the NOTCH2 gene are associated with Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. These mutations lead to a version of the Notch2 receptor that cannot be broken down normally. As a result, the receptor continues to be active even after signaling should stop. Researchers are unsure how excessive Notch2 signaling is related to the varied features of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. "
"Hashimoto thyroiditis",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hashimoto-thyroiditis,,"thin, dry hair","Hashimoto thyroiditis is a condition that affects the function of the thyroid, which is a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck. The thyroid makes hormones that help regulate a wide variety of critical body functions. For example, thyroid hormones influence growth and development, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycles, and weight. Hashimoto thyroiditis is a form of chronic inflammation that can damage the thyroid, reducing its ability to produce hormones. Other signs and symptoms resulting from an underactive thyroid can include excessive tiredness (fatigue), weight gain or difficulty losing weight, hair that is thin and dry,","Hashimoto thyroiditis is thought to result from a combination of genetic (CTLA4, HLA-DRB1, TG) and environmental factors. Some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown."
"Hennekam syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hennekam-syndrome,,"excessive body hair growth (hirsutism)","Hennekam syndrome is an inherited disorder resulting from malformation of the lymphatic system, which is part of both the circulatory system and immune system. Abnormalities found in a few individuals with Hennekam syndrome include a moderate to sever growth (hirsutism), ","Mutations in the CCBE1 or FAT4 gene can cause Hennekam syndrome."
"Hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-fibrosing-poikiloderma-with-tendon-contractures-myopathy-and-pulmonary-fibrosis,,"sparse hair","People with this disorder usually have sparse scalp hair, and their eyelashes and eyebrows can also be sparse or absent.","FAM111B gene mutations that cause POIKTMP result in production of an abnormal FAM111B protein from one copy of the gene in each cell. Because most of the FAM111B mutations identified in people with POIKTMP result in changes in the peptidase domain, researchers think that the mutations alter the protein's function, and that these changes in FAM111B function underlie the varied signs and symptoms of POIKTMP."
"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome,,"light hair colour","Affected individuals typically have fair skin and white or light-colored hair.","At least nine genes (AP3B1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S6, DTNBP1, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6) are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to make four distinct protein complexes. "
"Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/holocarboxylase-synthetase-deficiency,,"hair loss","The signs and symptoms of holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency typically appear within the first few months of life, but the age of onset varies. Affected infants often have hair loss (alopecia). Immediate treatment and lifelong management with biotin supplements may prevent many of these complications. ","Mutations in the HLCS gene reduce the enzyme's ability to attach biotin to these enzymes, preventing them from processing nutrients properly and disrupting many cellular functions. These defects lead to the serious medical problems associated with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency."
"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome,,"hair loss","Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of aging beginning in childhood.  Also causes hair loss (alopecia), ","Mutations in the LMNA gene cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Mutations that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal version of the lamin A protein. The altered protein makes the nuclear envelope unstable and progressively damages the nucleus, making cells more likely to die prematurely. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the characteristic features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome."
"Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hypohidrotic-ectodermal-dysplasia,,"Sparse hair, light-colored","Affected individuals tend to have sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis). The hair is often light-colored, brittle, and slow-growing. ","Mutations in the EDA, EDAR, or EDARADD gene prevent normal interactions between the ectoderm and the mesoderm and impair the normal development of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. The improper formation of these ectodermal structures leads to the characteristic features of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia."
"Ichthyosis with confetti",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ichthyosis-with-confetti,,"excess hair growth in some part of body","In addition to red, scaly skin, people with ichthyosis with confetti typically have excess hair (hirsutism) on some parts of the body, particularly on the arms and legs. ","KRT10 gene mutations associated with ichthyosis with confetti alter the keratin 10 protein. The altered protein is abnormally transported to the nucleus of cells, where it cannot form networks of intermediate filaments. Loss of these networks disrupts the epidermis, contributing to the red, scaly skin. However, in some abnormal cells, the mutated gene corrects itself through a complex process by which genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes. As a result, normal keratin 10 protein is produced and remains in the cytoplasm. The cell becomes normal and, as it continues to grow and divide, forms small patches of normal skin that give ichthyosis with confetti its name."
"Incontinentia pigmenti",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/incontinentia-pigmenti,,"Hair loss","Incontinentia pigmenti is a condition that can affect many body systems, particularly the skin. This condition occurs much more often in females than in males. Other signs and symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti can include hair loss (alopecia) affecting the scalp and other parts of the body","About 80 percent of affected individuals have a mutation that deletes some genetic material from the IKBKG gene. This deletion probably leads to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the IKBKG protein. Other people with incontinentia pigmenti have mutations that prevent the production of any IKBKG protein. Without this protein, nuclear factor-kappa-B is not regulated properly, and cells are more sensitive to signals that trigger them to self-destruct. Researchers believe that this abnormal cell death leads to the signs and symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti."
"Junctional epidermolysis bullosa",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/junctional-epidermolysis-bullosa,,"Hair loss","Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Other complications can include hair loss (alopecia). Because the signs and symptoms of Herlitz JEB are so severe, infants with this condition usually do not survive beyond the first year of life.","Junctional epidermolysis bullosa results from mutations in the LAMA3, LAMB3, LAMC2, and COL17A1 genes. Mutations in each of these genes can cause Herlitz JEB or non-Herlitz JEB. LAMB3 gene mutations are the most common, causing about 70 percent of all cases of junctional epidermolysis bullosa."
"Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness-syndrome,,"Partial hair loss","Partial hair loss is a common feature of KID syndrome, and often affects the eyebrows and eyelashes. ","The GJB2 gene mutations that cause KID syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in connexin 26. The mutations are thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. Death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the ichthyosis and deafness that occur in KID syndrome. It is unclear how GJB2 gene mutations affect the eye."
"Keratoderma with woolly hair",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/keratoderma-with-woolly-hair,,"Coarse, dry, sparse scalp hair","Keratoderma with woolly hair is a group of related conditions that affect the skin and hair and in many cases increase the risk of potentially life-threatening heart problems. People with these conditions have hair that is unusually coarse, dry, fine, and tightly curled. In some cases, the hair is also sparse. ","Mutations in the JUP, DSP, DSC2, and KANK2 genes cause keratoderma with woolly hair types I through IV, respectively."
"Klinefelter syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/klinefelter-syndrome,,"Reduced facial and body hair","A chromosomal condition that affects male physical and cognitive development. A shortage of testosterone can lead to delayed or incomplete puberty, breast enlargement (gynecomastia), reduced facial and body hair, ","Most often, Klinefelter syndrome results from the presence of one extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell (47,XXY). Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome interfere with male sexual development, often preventing the testes from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Some people with features of Klinefelter syndrome have more than one extra sex chromosome in each cell (for example, 48,XXXY or 49,XXXXY). "
"Lamellar ichthyosis",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lamellar-ichthyosis,,"Hair loss","A condition that mainly affects the skin. Infants with this condition are typically born with a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. Affected individuals may also have hair loss (alopecia),","Mutations in one of many genes (ABCA12, CYP4F22, LIPN, NIPAL4, TGM1) can cause lamellar ichthyosis.M utations in the TGM1 gene are responsible for approximately 90 percent of cases of lamellar ichthyosis. "
"Laron syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/laron-syndrome,,"Thin hair","A rare form of short stature that results from the body's inability to use growth hormone, a substance produced by the brain's pituitary gland that helps promote growth.Other feature s of untreated Laron syndrome include reduced musc thin and fragile","Mutations in the GHR gene impair the receptor's ability to bind to growth hormone or to trigger signaling within cells. As a result, even when growth hormone is available, cells are unable to respond by producing IGF-I and stimulating growth and division. "
"Lateral meningocele syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lateral-meningocele-syndrome,,"Coarse hair","Affected individuals may have coarse hair","The NOTCH3 gene mutations that cause lateral meningocele syndrome occur at the end of the gene in a region known as exon 33. These gene mutations result in a NOTCH3 protein with an abnormally short (truncated) NICD. The shortened protein is missing the portion that normally causes the breakdown of the NICD after it has performed its function in the cell nucleus and is no longer needed. As a result, the presence of the NICD in the cell is prolonged, and the protein continues to affect the activity of other genes. However, the result of this prolonged NICD activity and its connection to the specific features of lateral meningocele syndrome are not well understood."
"Lipoid proteinosis",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lipoid-proteinosis,,"Hair loss","Lipoid proteinosis is a condition that results from the formation of numerous small clumps (deposits) of proteins and other molecules in various tissues throughout the body. These tiny clumps appear in the skin, upper respiratory tract, the moist tissues that line body openings such as the eyelids and the inside of the mouth (mucous membranes), and other areas. Some people with this condition have hair loss (alopecia) affecting their scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows.","ECM1 gene mutations that cause lipoid proteinosis result in the production of a nonfunctional protein or no protein at all. A lack of functional ECM1 protein reduces binding between ECM1 and other proteins, leading to an unstable extracellular matrix. Without adequate support from the extracellular matrix, cells in the skin and other tissues are weakened. However, the cause of the deposits in skin and other tissues is not clear. The unstable extracellular matrix may cause neighboring cells to overproduce proteins and other materials. It is possible that, as these excess substances accumulate in tissues, they create the deposits characteristic of lipoid proteinosis."
"Mandibuloacral dysplasia",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mandibuloacral-dysplasia,,"Hair loss","Some people with this condition have features of premature aging (a condition called progeria), such as thin skin, loss of teeth, loss of hair","Mutations in the LMNA gene cause MADA, and mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene cause MADB. Within cells, these genes are involved in maintaining the structure of the nucleus and may play a role in many cellular processes."
"Meier-Gorlin syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/meier-gorlin-syndrome,,"Sparse or absent of underarm hair","Both males and females with this condition can have sparse or absent underarm (axillary) hair.","Meier-Gorlin syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of several genes. Each of these genes, ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6, provides instructions for making one of a group of proteins known as the pre-replication complex. Mutations in any one of these genes impair formation of the pre-replication complex and disrupt replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome."
"Menkes syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/menkes-syndrome,,"Sparse coarse hair","A disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair. Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair,","Mutations in the ATP7A gene result in poor distribution of copper to the body's cells. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels of copper. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of Menkes syndrome and occipital horn syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes."
"Microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/microcephaly-capillary-malformation-syndrome,,"Unusual pattern of hair growth","An inherited disorder characterized by an abnormally small head size (microcephaly) and abnormalities of small blood vessels in the skin called capillaries (capillary malformations).Some affected children also have distinctive facial features and an unusual pattern of hair growth on the scalp.","Mutations in the STAMBP gene reduce or eliminate the production of STAM binding protein. This shortage allows damaged or unneeded proteins to build up inside cells instead of being degraded or recycled, which may damage cells and cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). Researchers suspect that abnormal apoptosis of brain cells starting before birth may cause microcephaly and the underlying brain abnormalities found in people with microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome. A lack of STAM binding protein also alters multiple signaling pathways that are necessary for normal development, which may underlie the capillary malformations and other signs and symptoms of the condition."
Monilethrix,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/monilethrix,,"sparse hair","A condition that affects hair growth. Its most characteristic feature is that individual strands of hair have a beaded appearance like the beads of a necklace. People with monilethrix also have sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis) and short, brittle hair that breaks easily.","Monilethrix is caused by mutations in one of several genes. Mutations in the KRT81 gene, the KRT83 gene, the KRT86 gene, or the DSG4 gene account for most cases of monilethrix. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that give structure and strength to strands of hair."
"Müllerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mullerian-aplasia-and-hyperandrogenism,,"excess face hair","Women with Müllerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism have higher-than-normal levels of male sex hormones called androgens in their blood (hyperandrogenism), which can cause acne and excessive facial hair (facial hirsutism). ","Mutations in the WNT4 gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the WNT4 protein. Researchers suspect that the altered protein cannot be released from cells as it normally would be; the trapped protein is unable to perform its usual functions. Loss of regulation by WNT4 likely disrupts development of the female reproductive system and induces abnormal production of androgens, leading to the features of Müllerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism."
"Multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/multicentric-osteolysis-nodulosis-and-arthropathy,,"excess hair growth","Other features of MONA can include clouding of the clear front covering of the eye (corneal opacity), excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), ","The MMP2 gene mutations that cause MONA completely eliminate the activity of the matrix metallopeptidase 2 enzyme, preventing the normal cleavage of type IV collagen. It is unclear how a loss of enzyme activity leads to the specific features of MONA."
"Multiple sulfatase deficiency",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/multiple-sulfatase-deficiency,,"excess hair growth","The neonatal type is the most severe form, with signs and symptoms appearing soon after birth. Affected individuals have dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis) and excess hair growth (hypertrichosis)","Most SUMF1 gene mutations severely reduce the function of the FGE enzyme or lead to the production of an unstable enzyme that is quickly broken down. The activity of multiple sulfatases is impaired because the FGE enzyme modifies all known sulfatase enzymes. Sulfate-containing molecules that are not broken down build up in cells, often resulting in cell death. The death of cells in particular tissues, specifically the brain, skeleton, and skin, cause many of the signs and symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency."
