Other methods test only for those variants most commonly found in Caucasians, potentially missing CF-causing variants across broader ethnic groups. The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay offers the largest CF variant panel to overcome this bias and provide comprehensive detection across diverse demographics. The test is intended for carrier screening in adults of reproductive age, in confirmatory diagnostic testing of newborns and children, and as an initial test to aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cystic fibrosis. The results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other available laboratory and clinical information. This test is not indicated for use for newborn screening, fetal diagnostic testing, pre-implantation testing, or for stand-alone diagnostic purposes.","2.5 days",MiSeqDx,"MiSeq Reporter"
"MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay","In vitro diagnostic product",Illumina,"250ng genomic DNA isolated from human peripheral whole blood specimens collected in K2EDTA","Cystic Fibrosis testing","SBS: sequencing by synthesis",,"The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay is the first FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) next-generation sequencing (NGS) test designed to sequence all protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the CFTR gene, including two large deletions, two deep intronic mutations, and indels in homopolymeric regions such as the 2184delA deletion. The assay also automatically detects polyTG/polyT variants. Viewing the CFTR sequence eliminates any bias inherent in existing cystic fibrosis (CF) panels. As a result, the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay can uncover rare mutations not accounted for in standard tests. Capture all variants in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the CFTR gene. Deep coverage (> 3,000×) allows detection accuracy with a Positive Agreement (PA) of 99.66%* The test is intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cystic fibrosis (CF). This assay is most appropriate when the patient has an atypical or non-classic presentation of CF or when other mutation panels have failed to identify both causative mutations. The results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other available information including clinical symptoms, other diagnostic tests, and family history. This test is not indicated for use for stand-alone diagnostic purposes, fetal diagnostic testing, preimplantation testing, carrier screening, newborn screening, or population screening.","2.5 days",MiSeqDx,"MiSeq Reporter"
