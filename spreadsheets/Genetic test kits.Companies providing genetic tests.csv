If the test identifies any marker for a potentially pathological condition, contact your GP with your results for further information.",Saliva,"Results online 4-6 weeks after samples arrive the lab and the raw data will be available as well","Tintagel House, 92 Albert Embankment, Lambeth, London, SE1 7TP, United Kingdom"
CA,23andMe,https://www.23andme.com/en-gb/compare-dna-tests/,"Ancestry service (79GBP) Health + Ancestry service (149 GBP) (can review the DNA result regularly, for genetic traits info and health risk) (remarks: raw data feature is suitably only for informational use and not for medical, diagnostic or other use. Consult with a healthcare professional before making any major changes in lifestyle) (The test does not cover the variants that maybe more common in people of Asian descent)All saliva samples are processed in labs in the United States that meet local regulations. Once participants answer online survey questions, researchers link their genetic data to study topics from ancestry, to traits, to disease. These contributions help drive scientific discoveries. The choice to opt into or out of research is always up to the participant. 23andMe is the first and only genetic service available directly to consumers that includes reports that meet FDA standards. ","Genotyping. The technology 23andMe uses looks for specific typos (variants) in the gene instructions (called SNPs or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). This approach to testing, called genotyping, is not designed to identify all potential variants.Once our lab receives your sample, DNA is extracted from cells contained in your saliva. The lab then copies the DNA many times—a process called amplification—duplicating the tiny amount extracted from your saliva until there is enough to be genotyped.In order to be genotyped, the amplified DNA is “cut” into smaller pieces, which are then applied to our DNA chip (also known as a microarray), a small glass slide with millions of microscopic “beads” on its surface. Each bead is attached to a “probe,"" a bit of DNA that matches one of the genetic variants that we test. The cut pieces of your DNA stick to the matching DNA probes. A fluorescent label on each probe identifies which version of that genetic variant your DNA corresponds to. Genotyping Chips manufactured by Illumina and customed designed",Saliva,"In approximately 6-8 weeks, we will send you an email to let you know your reports are ready in your online account.
