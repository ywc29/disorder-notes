Consult with a healthcare professional before making any major changes in lifestyle) (The test does not cover the variants that maybe more common in people of Asian descent)All saliva samples are processed in labs in the United States that meet local regulations. Once participants answer online survey questions, researchers link their genetic data to study topics from ancestry, to traits, to disease. These contributions help drive scientific discoveries. The choice to opt into or out of research is always up to the participant. 23andMe is the first and only genetic service available directly to consumers that includes reports that meet FDA standards. ","Genotyping. The technology 23andMe uses looks for specific typos (variants) in the gene instructions (called SNPs or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). This approach to testing, called genotyping, is not designed to identify all potential variants.Once our lab receives your sample, DNA is extracted from cells contained in your saliva. The lab then copies the DNA many times—a process called amplification—duplicating the tiny amount extracted from your saliva until there is enough to be genotyped.In order to be genotyped, the amplified DNA is “cut” into smaller pieces, which are then applied to our DNA chip (also known as a microarray), a small glass slide with millions of microscopic “beads” on its surface. Each bead is attached to a “probe,"" a bit of DNA that matches one of the genetic variants that we test. The cut pieces of your DNA stick to the matching DNA probes. A fluorescent label on each probe identifies which version of that genetic variant your DNA corresponds to.

Germany,"MGZ Medical Genetics Center. ",,"90% of the samples MGZ analyzes with the CytoSNP-850K BeadChip are postnatal. These analyses help identify the causes of autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability (ID), dysmorphic features, or neurological disorders such as epilepsy. MGZ also performs prenatal analysis with conventional karyotyping, chromosomal microarrays, and noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for chromosomal aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). Uses the MiSeq and NextSeq®500 Systems to run a large number of custom panels to identify variants associated with rare hereditary diseases and the TruSight Cancer Sequencing Panel, which targets 94 genes with suspected associations to common and rare cancers. The sequencing panel also includes 284 SNPs suspected to correlate with cancer through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).The TruSight Cancer Sequencing Panel is a test method that anyone 
can adapt easily in their laboratory,” Dr. Benet-Pagès said. “It’s easy to implement in automated workflows and performs with high repeatability and reproducibility. The TruSight Cancer Panel enables us to analyze more genes in a single workflow than previous technologies. The advantage is that we can identify potential mutations in cancer associated genes not primarily tested.","Infinium CytoSNP-850K BeadChip ",,,,
