"16p11.2 duplication",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/16p112-duplication,"16p11.2 duplications have been estimated to occur in about 3 in 10,000 people. These changes are present in about 4 in 10,000 people who have mental health problems or difficulties with speech and language. Many people with the duplication are likely never diagnosed because there are many causes of these problems, and some people with the duplication have no related health or developmental problems."
"16p12.2 microdeletion",https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/16p122-microdeletion,"Researchers estimate that about 1 in 2,000 newborns have a 16p12.2 microdeletion and show signs and symptoms of the condition. However, the actual number may be higher because many people with the microdeletion are likely never diagnosed. Some never come to medical attention because they have no related health or behavioral problems or have only mild signs and symptoms. Others have nonspecific features for which there can be many causes."
