Analysis-Software: Comprehensive data analysis with intuitive BlueFuse Multi Software streamlines copy number assessment and results reporting (When I look at the data using the BlueFuse Multi Software, theres rarely any variant I cant match with the databases,Dr. Koehler added.I like the links to the genome browsers and the zoom in and query capability to compare regions with other results. Creating batch files is easy, too. I can import the labs entire database to the BlueFuse Multi Software with just one click. I can analyze more patients in a shorter timeframe, which is very helpful for the lab workflow.)

Input-DNA: 250ng genomic DNA from peripheral whole blood sample
Function: Cystic Fibrosis testing
Technology: SBS: sequencing by synthesis
Gene-database: The variants include those recommended in 2004 by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)3 and in 2011 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)4.
Principal: The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay is an FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) next-generation sequencing test designed to detect 139 CFTR variants as defined in the CFTR2 database. Other methods test only for those variants most commonly found in Caucasians, potentially missing CF-causing variants across broader ethnic groups. The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay offers the largest CF variant panel to overcome this bias and provide comprehensive detection across diverse demographics. The test is intended for carrier screening in adults of reproductive age, in confirmatory diagnostic testing of newborns and children, and as an initial test to aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cystic fibrosis. The results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other available laboratory and clinical information. This test is not indicated for use for newborn screening, fetal diagnostic testing, pre-implantation testing, or for stand-alone diagnostic purposes.

Input-DNA: 250ng genomic DNA isolated from human peripheral whole blood specimens collected in K2EDTA
Function: Cystic Fibrosis testing
Technology: SBS: sequencing by synthesis
Principal: The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay is the first FDA-clearedin vitro diagnostic (IVD) next-generation sequencing (NGS) test designed to sequence all protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the CFTR gene, including two large deletions, two deep intronic mutations, and indels in homopolymeric regions such as the 2184delA deletion. The assay also automatically detects polyTG/polyT variants. Viewing the CFTR sequence eliminates any bias inherent in existing cystic fibrosis (CF) panels. As a result, the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay can uncover rare mutations not accounted for in standard tests. Capture all variants in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the CFTR gene. Deep coverage (3,000) allows detection accuracy with a Positive Agreement (PA) of 99.66%* The test is intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cystic fibrosis (CF). This assay is most appropriate when the patient has an atypical or non-classic presentation of CF or when other mutation panels have failed to identify both causative mutations. The results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other available information including clinical symptoms, other diagnostic tests, and family history. This test is not indicated for use for stand-alone diagnostic purposes, fetal diagnostic testing, preimplantation testing, carrier screening, newborn screening, or population screening.

Function: Non-invasive Prenatal test (NIPT)
Technology: The DANSR assay technology specifically targets just the chromosomes of interest for deep, directed analysis.1This reduces complexity of unutilized sequencing data compared to massively parallel shotgun sequencing (MPSS) techniques.1, In practice, DANSR assay technology significantly improves assay efficiency and reduces overall test cost.2  Together the DANSR assay and FORTE algorithm are optimized to provide a streamlined workflow.The Harmony test uses SNPs to analyze and report fetal fraction for every sample. SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation between individuals, with a normal occurrence of one in every 300 nucleotides.4,5 Detection of these variations allows for accurate determination of fetal fraction.     Ion semiconductor sequencing (Ion Torrent)
Principal: Since 2012 the Harmony prenatal test has been ordered for more than 1.4 million women and is trusted by healthcare providers in more than 100 countries. Contain tests for trisomy21, 18, 13, Fetal Sex,Monosomy X*, Sex Chromosome Aneuploidies*, 22q11.2 deletion*. The Harmony test is the most broadly studied cell-free DNA test with greater than 148,000 women studied in 48 peer-reviewed publications

Name: * Depends largely how the library is prepared. Library preparation is a critical step in the WGS workflow.  DNA is first fragmented to the appropriate size, after which platform-specific adapters are added. PCR-free workflows are preferred for WGS, but in cases where input DNA is limited or is of poor quality, library amplification has to be performed. WGS library construction protocols typically include a size-selection step as libraries with a narrow fragment distribution are generally preferred. After sequencing, the sequence reads are aligned against a reference genome (reference-guided sequence assembly), or when no such reference is available, compared to each other and assembled into long contiguous segments (de novo sequencing).

Each bead is attached to aprobe,a bit of DNA that matches one of the genetic variants that we test. The cut pieces of your DNA stick to the matching DNA probes.
