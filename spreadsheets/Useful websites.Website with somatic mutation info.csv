"CFTR2 database",https://www.cftr2.org/,"Provides information for patients, researchers, and the general public about specific variants in what is commonly referred to as the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene. For each variant or variant combination included in the database, the website will provide information about:1. Whether the variant or variant combination is CF-causing, and2. Information about sweat chloride, lung function, pancreatic status, and Pseudomonas infection rate in patients in the CFTR2 database with this variant or variant combination."
SNPaedia,SNPedia.com,"SNPedia is a collection of the subset of SNPs that have been reported to be meaningful, either medically or for other reasons (such as for genealogy). The emphasis in SNPedia is on SNPs that have significant medical consequences, are common, are reproducible (or found in meta-analyses or studies of at least 500 patients), and/or have other historic or medical significance.
