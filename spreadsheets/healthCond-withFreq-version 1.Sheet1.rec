GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/17-alpha-hydroxylase-17-20-lyase-deficiency
frequency1: 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency accounts for about 1 percent of congenital adrenal hyperplasia cases. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 1 million people worldwide.
Description1: html  html:p 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is a condition that affects the  function of certain hormone-producing glands called the gonads (ovaries in  females and testes in males) and the adrenal glands. The gonads direct sexual  development before birth and during puberty and are important for reproduction.  The adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys, regulate the  production of certain hormones, including those that control salt levels in the  body. People with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency have an imbalance of  many of the hormones that are made in these glands. 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase  deficiency is one of a group of disorders, known as congenital adrenal  hyperplasias, that impair hormone production and disrupt sexual development and  maturation. html:p Hormone imbalances lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of  17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which include high blood pressure  (hypertension), low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), and abnormal  sexual development. The severity of the features varies. Two forms of the  condition are recognized: complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which  is more severe, and partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which is  typically less so. html:p Males and females are affected by disruptions to sexual development differently.  Females (who have two X chromosomes) with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase  deficiency are born with normal external female genitalia; however, the internal  reproductive organs, including the uterus and ovaries, may be underdeveloped.  Women with complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency do not develop  secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and pubic hair, and do not  menstruate (amenorrhea). Women with partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase  <span style="color:#FF3333;"><font color="#FF3333">deficiency may develop some secondary sex characteristics; menstruation is</font></span>  <span style="color:#FF3333;"><font color="#FF3333">typically irregular or absent. Either form of the disorder results in an</font></span>  <span style="color:#FF3333;"><font color="#FF3333">inability to conceive a baby (infertility).</font></span> html:p In affected individuals who are chromosomally male (having an X and a Y  chromosome), problems with sexual development lead to  <span style="color:#FF3333;"><font color="#FF3333">. The most severely affected are born with characteristically</font></span>  <span style="color:#FF3333;"><font color="#FF3333">female external genitalia and are generally raised as females. However, because</font></span>  they do not have female internal reproductive organs, these individuals have  amenorrhea and do not develop female secondary sex characteristics. These  individuals have testes, but they are abnormally located in the abdomen  (undescended). Sometimes, complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency leads  to external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous  genitalia). Males with partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency usually  Have , such as a ,  <span style="color:#FF3333;"><font color="#FF3333">, or a scrotum divided</font></span>  <span style="color:#FF3333;"><font color="#FF3333">into two lobes (bifid scrotum).

Description1: html  html:p 21-hydroxylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects the adrenal  glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a  variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body.

Two types are classic forms,  known as the salt-wasting and simple virilizing types. The third type is called  the non-classic type. The salt-wasting type is the most severe, the simple  virilizing type is less severe, and the non-classic type is the least severe  form. html:p Males and females with either classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency tend to  <span style="color:#FF3300;"><font color="#FF3300">have an early growth spurt, but their final adult height is usually shorter than</font></span>  <span style="color:#FF3300;"><font color="#FF3300">others in their family.

Hormone production is extremely low in this form of  the disorder. Affected individuals lose large amounts of sodium in their urine,  which can be life-threatening in early infancy. Babies with the salt-wasting  type can experience poor feeding, weight loss, dehydration, and vomiting.  Individuals with the simple virilizing form do not experience salt loss. html:p In both the salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms of this disorder, females  typically have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female  (ambiguous genitalia). Males usually have normal genitalia, but the testes may  be small. html:p Females with the non-classic type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have normal  female genitalia. As affected females get older, they may experience hirsutism,  <span style="color:#FF3300;"><font color="#FF3300">male pattern baldness, irregular menstruation, and decreased fertility.

The cancerous lymphoid cells grow and divide in  lymph nodes, forming a tumor that enlarges the lymph nodes. In most cases of  8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, the cancerous cells are lymphoid cells called  T cells. Lymphoma can develop at the same time as the myeloproliferative  disorder or later. html:p In most people with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, the myeloproliferative  disorder develops into a fast-growing blood cancer called acute myeloid  leukemia. html:p The rapid myeloid and lymphoid cell production caused by these cancers results  in enlargement of the spleen and liver (splenomegaly and hepatomegaly,  respectively). Most people with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome have symptoms  such as fatigue or night sweats. Some affected individuals have no symptoms, and  the condition is discovered through routine blood tests.

Other physical changes that are sometimes associated with a 9q22.3  microdeletion include the premature fusion of certain bones in the skull  (metopic craniosynostosis) and a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus).  Affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features such as a  prominent forehead with vertical skin creases, upward- or downward-slanting  eyes, a short nose, and a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum). html:p 8.88888888888889E+23  (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome). This genetic condition  affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various  cancerous and noncancerous tumors. In people with Gorlin syndrome, the type of  cancer diagnosed most often is basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common  form of skin cancer. Most people with this condition also develop noncancerous  (benign) tumors of the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumors, which can  cause facial swelling and tooth displacement. Other types of tumors that occur  in some people with Gorlin syndrome include a form of childhood brain cancer  called a medulloblastoma and a type of benign tumor called a fibroma that occurs  in the heart or in a woman's ovaries. Other features of Gorlin syndrome include  small s (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the  feet; an unusually large head size (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead;  and skeletal abnormalities involving the spine, ribs, or skull.

Name1: Abdominal wall defect
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/abdominal-wall-defect
frequency1: Abdominal wall defects are uncommon. Omphalocele affects an estimated 2 to 2.5 in 10,000 newborns. Approximately 2 to 6 in 10,000 newborns are affected by gastroschisis, although researchers have observed that this malformation is becoming more common. Abdominal wall defects are more common among pregnancies that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths).
Description1: html  html:p An abdominal wall defect is an opening in the abdomen through which various  abdominal organs can protrude. This opening varies in size and can usually be  diagnosed early in fetal development, typically between the tenth and fourteenth  weeks of pregnancy. There are two main types of abdominal wall defects:  omphalocele and gastroschisis. Omphalocele is an opening in the center of the  abdominal wall where the umbilical cord meets the abdomen. Organs (typically the  intestines, stomach, and liver) protrude through the opening into the umbilical  cord and are covered by the same protective membrane that covers the umbilical  cord. Gastroschisis is a defect in the abdominal wall, usually to the right of  the umbilical cord, through which the large and small intestines protrude  (although other organs may sometimes bulge out). There is no membrane covering  the exposed organs in gastroschisis. html:p Fetuses with omphalocele may grow slowly before birth (intrauterine growth  retardation) and they may be born prematurely. Individuals with omphalocele  frequently have multiple birth defects, such as a congenital .  Additionally,  is often associated with omphalocele  because the abdominal organs normally provide a framework for chest wall  growth. When those organs are misplaced, the chest wall does not form properly,  providing a smaller than normal space for the lungs to develop. As a result,  many infants with omphalocele have respiratory insufficiency and may need to be  supported with a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). Rarely,  affected individuals who have breathing problems in infancy experience recurrent  lung infections or asthma later in life. Affected infants often have  gastrointestinal problems including a backflow of stomach acids into the  esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) and feeding difficulty; these problems can  persist even after treatment of omphalocele. Large omphaloceles or those  associated with multiple additional health problems are more often associated  with fetal death than cases in which omphalocele occurs alone (isolated). html:p Omphalocele is a feature of many genetic syndromes. Nearly half of individuals  with omphalocele have a condition caused by an extra copy of one of the  chromosomes in each of their cells (trisomy). Up to one-third of people born  with omphalocele have a genetic condition called Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  Affected individuals may have additional signs and symptoms associated with  these genetic conditions. html:p Individuals who have gastroschisis rarely have other birth defects and seldom  have chromosome abnormalities or a genetic condition. Most affected individuals  experience  and are ; many affected  infants are born prematurely. html:p With gastroschisis, the protruding organs are not covered by a protective  membrane and are susceptible to damage due to direct contact with amniotic fluid  in the womb. Components of the amniotic fluid may trigger immune responses and  inflammatory reactions against the intestines that can damage the tissue.  Constriction around exposed organs at the abdominal wall opening late in fetal  development may also contribute to organ injury. Intestinal damage causes  impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract  (peristalsis) in most children with gastroschisis. In these individuals,  peristalsis usually improves in a few months and intestinal muscle contractions  normalize. Rarely, children with gastroschisis have a narrowing or absence of a  portion of intestine (intestinal atresia) or twisting of the intestine. After  birth, these intestinal malformations can lead to problems with digestive  function, further loss of intestinal tissue, and a condition called short bowel  syndrome that occurs when areas of the small intestine are missing, causing  dehydration and poor absorption of nutrients. Depending on the severity of the  condition, intravenous feedings (parenteral nutrition) may be required. html:p The health of an individual with gastroschisis depends largely on how damaged  his or her intestine was before birth. When the abdominal wall defect is  repaired and normal intestinal function is recovered, the vast majority of  affected individuals have no health problems related to the repaired defect  later in life.

frequency1: Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases described worldwide.
Description1: html  html:p Abetalipoproteinemia is an inherited disorder that affects the absorption of  dietary fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. People affected by this  disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are particles that  carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood.  Specifically, people with abetalipoproteinemia are missing a group of  lipoproteins called beta-lipoproteins. An inability to make beta-lipoproteins  causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and  fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) from the digestive tract into the  bloodstream. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are  necessary for ,  and tissues, particularly nerve cells and tissues in the eye. html:p The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of  life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate  (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal star-shaped red blood cells  (acanthocytosis); and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). Other features  of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of  the nervous system. Disturbances in nerve function may cause affected people  to eventually develop poor muscle coordination and  . Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye  disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which progressive degeneration of the  light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss.  Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance  and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from  a severe vitamin deficiency, especially a deficiency of vitamin E.

Some develop  problems  and a decline of  function (dementia) in their forties or fifties. html:p In addition to neurological problems, affected individuals may have diabetes  mellitus caused by iron damage to cells in the pancreas that make insulin, a  hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. Iron accumulation in the pancreas  reduces the cells' ability to make insulin, which impairs blood sugar  regulation and leads to the signs and symptoms of diabetes. html:p Iron accumulation in the tissues and organs results in a corresponding shortage  (deficiency) of iron in the blood, leading to a shortage of red blood cells  (anemia).

Name1: Achondroplasia
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/achondroplasia
frequency1: Achondroplasia is the most common type of short-limbed dwarfism. The condition occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 40,000 newborns.
Description1: html  html:p Achondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. The word achondroplasia  literally means"without cartilage formation."Cartilage is a tough but flexible  tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. However, in  achondroplasia the problem is not in forming cartilage but in converting it to  bone (a process called ossification), particularly in the long bones of the arms  and legs. Achondroplasia is similar to another skeletal disorder called  hypochondroplasia, but the features of achondroplasia tend to be more severe. html:p All people with achondroplasia have . The average height of an  adult male with achondroplasia is 131 centimeters (4 feet, 4 inches), and the  average height for adult females is 124 centimeters (4 feet, 1 inch).  Characteristic features of achondroplasia include an average-size trunk, short  arms and legs with particularly short upper arms and thighs, limited range of  motion at the elbows, and an enlarged head (macrocephaly) with a prominent  forehead. Fingers are typically short and the ring finger and middle finger may  diverge, giving the hand a three-pronged (trident) appearance. People with  achondroplasia are generally of normal intelligence. html:p Health problems commonly associated with achondroplasia include episodes in  which breathing slows or stops for short periods (apnea), obesity, and recurrent  ear infections. In childhood, individuals with the condition usually develop a  pronounced and permanent sway of the lower back (lordosis) and bowed legs. Some  affected people also develop abnormal front-to-back curvature of the spine  (kyphosis) and back pain. A potentially serious complication of achondroplasia  is spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal that can pinch  (compress) the upper part of the spinal cord. Spinal stenosis is associated with  pain, tingling, and weakness in the legs that can cause difficulty with  walking. Another uncommon but serious complication of achondroplasia is  hydrocephalus, which is a buildup of fluid in the brain in affected children  that can lead to increased head size and related brain abnormalities.

People with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors;  they see only black, white, and shades of gray. Incomplete achromatopsia is a  milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination. html:p Achromatopsia also involves other problems with vision, including an increased  sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye  movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual  acuity). Affected individuals can also have farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less  commonly, nearsightedness (myopia). These vision problems develop in the first  few months of life. html:p Achromatopsia is different from the more common forms of color vision deficiency  (also called color blindness), in which people can perceive color but have  difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, such as red and green.

Description1: html  html:p Acral peeling skin syndrome is a skin disorder characterized by painless peeling  of the top layer of skin. The term"acral"refers to the fact that the skin  peeling in this condition is most apparent on the hands and feet. Occasionally,  peeling also occurs on the arms and legs. The peeling is usually evident from  birth, although the condition can also begin in childhood or later in life. Skin  peeling is made worse by exposure to heat, humidity and other forms of  moisture, and friction. The underlying skin may be temporarily red and itchy,  but it typically heals without scarring. Acral peeling skin syndrome is not  associated with any other health problems.

Affected individuals often develop carpal tunnel syndrome, which is  characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers. A  misalignment of the hip joints (hip dysplasia) can also occur in this disorder.  These skeletal and joint problems may require treatment, but most affected  individuals have few limitations in their activities. html:p Children with acromicric dysplasia may have a round face, sharply defined  eyebrows, long eyelashes, a bulbous nose with upturned nostrils, a long space  between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), and a small mouth with thick lips.  These facial differences become less apparent in adulthood. Intelligence is  unaffected in this disorder, and life expectancy is generally normal.

Over time, s can affect other parts of the body, such as the  head, torso, legs, and tongue. Eventually, the s worsen to become  myoclonic jerks, which can be triggered by voluntary movements or the intention  to move (action myoclonus). These myoclonic jerks typically occur in the torso;  upper and lower limbs; and face, particularly the muscles around the mouth and  the eyelids. , excitement, stress, or extreme tiredness (fatigue) can  worsen the myoclonus. Some affected individuals develop , a loss of  sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), or hearing loss  caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). Severe  or myoclonus can be life-threatening. html:p When kidney problems occur, an early sign is excess protein in the urine  (proteinuria).

Description1: html  html:p Activated PI3K-delta syndrome is a disorder that impairs the immune system.  Individuals with this condition often have low numbers of white blood cells  (lymphopenia), particularly B cells and T cells. Normally, these cells recognize  and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent  infection. Beginning in childhood, people with activated PI3K-delta syndrome  develop recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Over  time, recurrent respiratory tract infections can lead to a condition called  bronchiectasis, which damages the passages leading from the windpipe to the  lungs (bronchi) and can cause breathing problems. People with activated  PI3K-delta syndrome may also have chronic active viral infections, commonly  Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infections. html:p Another possible feature of activated PI3K-delta syndrome is abnormal clumping  of white blood cells. These clumps can lead to enlarged lymph nodes  (lymphadenopathy), or the white blood cells can build up to form solid masses  (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia), usually in the moist lining of the airways or  intestines. While lymphadenopathy and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia are  noncancerous (benign), activated PI3K-delta syndrome also increases the risk of  developing a form of cancer called B-cell lymphoma.

People with this condition usually show typical symptoms of an  infection, such as fever, cough, congestion, vomiting, and diarrhea, for a few  days. Following these flu-like symptoms, affected individuals develop  neurological problems, such as , hallucinations,  , or abnormal muscle tone. Eventually, most affected  individuals go into a coma, which usually lasts for a number of weeks. The  condition is described as"acute"because the episodes of illness are  time-limited. html:p People with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 develop areas of damage  (lesions) in certain regions of the brain. As the condition progresses, these  brain regions develop swelling (edema), bleeding (hemorrhage), and then tissue  death (necrosis). The progressive brain damage and tissue loss results in  encephalopathy. html:p Approximately one-third of individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy  type 1 do not survive their illness and subsequent neurological decline.

Over time, many of these skills may be regained, but the loss of  brain tissue is permanent. Other individuals who survive their illness appear to  recover completely. html:p It is estimated that half of individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy  type 1 are susceptible to recurrent episodes and will have another infection  that results in neurological decline; some people may have numerous episodes  throughout their lives.

Description1: html  html:p Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a form of acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer of  the blood-forming tissue (bone marrow). In normal bone marrow, hematopoietic  stem cells produce red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, white blood  cells (leukocytes) that protect the body from infection, and platelets  (thrombocytes) that are involved in blood clotting. In acute promyelocytic  leukemia, immature white blood cells called promyelocytes accumulate in the bone  marrow. The overgrowth of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white and  red blood cells and platelets in the body, which causes many of the signs and  symptoms of the condition. html:p People with acute promyelocytic leukemia are especially susceptible to  developing bruises, small red dots under the skin (petechiae), nosebleeds,  bleeding from the gums, blood in the urine (hematuria), or excessive menstrual  bleeding. The abnormal bleeding and bruising occur in part because of the low  number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) and also because the  cancerous cells release substances that cause excessive bleeding. html:p The low number of red blood cells (anemia) can cause people with acute  promyelocytic leukemia to have pale skin (pallor) or excessive tiredness  (fatigue). In addition, affected individuals may heal slowly from injuries or  have frequent infections due to the loss of normal white blood cells that fight  infection. Furthermore, the leukemic cells can spread to the bones and joints,  which may cause pain in those areas. Other general signs and symptoms may occur  as well, such as fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. html:p Acute promyelocytic leukemia is most often diagnosed around age 40, although it  can be diagnosed at any age.

frequency1: APRT deficiency is estimated to affect 1 in 27,000 people in Japan. The condition is rarer in Europe, where it is thought to affect 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 people. The prevalence of APRT deficiency outside these populations is unknown.
Description1: html  html:p Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency is an inherited condition  that affects the kidneys and urinary tract. The most common feature of this  condition is recurrent kidney stones; urinary tract stones are also a frequent  symptom. Kidney and urinary tract stones can create blockages in the urinary  tract, causing pain during urination and difficulty releasing urine. html:p Affected individuals can develop features of this condition anytime from infancy  to late adulthood. When the condition appears in infancy, the first sign is  usually the presence of tiny grains of reddish-brown material in the baby's  diaper caused by the passing of stones. Later, recurrent kidney and urinary  tract stones can lead to problems with kidney function beginning as early as  mid- to late childhood. Approximately half of individuals with APRT deficiency  first experience signs and symptoms of the condition in adulthood. The first  features in affected adults are usually kidney stones and related urinary  problems. Other signs and symptoms of APRT deficiency caused by kidney and  urinary tract stones include fever, urinary tract infection, blood in the urine  (hematuria), abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. html:p Without treatment, kidney function can decline, which may lead to end-stage  renal disease (ESRD). ESRD is a life-threatening failure of kidney function that  occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products  from the body effectively. html:p The features of this condition and their severity vary greatly among affected  individuals, even among members of the same family. It is estimated that 15 to  20 percent of people with APRT deficiency do not have any signs or symptoms of  the condition.

frequency1: Only a few dozen individuals with ADA2 deficiency have been described in the medical literature. However, researchers suspect that it may not be a rare disease. They are working to determine whether ADA2 deficiency could underlie other, more common forms of vasculitis and stroke whose causes are currently unknown.
Description1: html  html:p Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) deficiency is a disorder characterized by abnormal  inflammation of various tissues, particularly the blood vessels (vasculitis).  Signs and symptoms can begin anytime from early childhood to adulthood. The  severity of the disorder also varies, even among affected individuals in the  same family. html:p Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders  (such as bacteria). However, the uncontrolled inflammation that occurs in ADA2  deficiency can damage many of the body's tissues and organs, including the skin,  gastrointestinal system, kidneys, and nervous system. Depending on the severity  and location of the inflammation, the disorder can cause disability or be  life-threatening. Features that have been described in people with ADA2  deficiency include fevers that are intermittent, meaning they come and go; areas  of net-like, mottled skin discoloration called livedo racemosa; an enlarged  liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); and recurrent strokes affecting  structures deep in the brain that can start in the first few years of life. ADA2  deficiency causes mild immune system abnormalities in some individuals, but it  is usually not associated with a significantly increased risk of bacterial and  viral infections. html:p ADA2 deficiency is sometimes described as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN),  a disorder that causes inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body  (systemic vasculitis). However, not all researchers classify ADA2 deficiency as  a type of PAN.

Description1: html  html:p Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is an inherited disorder that damages the  immune system and causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with  SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or  life-threatening. These infections are often caused by"opportunistic"  organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune  system. html:p The main symptoms of ADA deficiency are pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and  widespread skin rashes. Affected children also grow much more slowly than  healthy children and some have html:p Most individuals with ADA deficiency are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6  months of life. Without treatment, these babies usually do not survive past age  2. In about 10 percent to 15 percent of cases, onset of immune deficiency is  delayed to between 6 and 24 months of age (delayed onset) or even until  adulthood (late onset). Immune deficiency in these later-onset cases tends to be  less severe, causing primarily recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections.  Over time, affected individuals may develop chronic lung damage, malnutrition,  and other health problems.

Description1: html  html:p Adermatoglyphia is the absence of ridges on the skin on the pads of the fingers  and toes, as well as on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The  patterns of these ridges (called dermatoglyphs) form whorls, arches, and loops  that are the basis for each person's unique fingerprints. Because no two people  have the same patterns, fingerprints have long been used as a way to identify  individuals. However, people with adermatoglyphia do not have these ridges, and  so they cannot be identified by their fingerprints. Adermatoglyphia has been  called the"immigration delay disease"because affected individuals have had  difficulty entering countries that require fingerprinting for identification. html:p In some families, adermatoglyphia occurs without any related signs and symptoms.  In others, a lack of dermatoglyphs is associated with other features, typically  affecting the skin. These can include small white bumps called milia on the  face, blistering of the skin in areas exposed to heat or friction, and a reduced  number of sweat glands on the hands and feet. Adermatoglyphia is also a feature  of several rare syndromes classified as ectodermal dysplasias, including a  condition called Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome/dermatopathia  pigmentosa reticularis that affects the skin, hair, sweat glands, and teeth.

frequency1: ALSP is thought to be a rare disorder, although the prevalence is unknown. Because it can be mistaken for other disorders with similar symptoms, ALSP may be underdiagnosed.
Description1: html  html:p Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP)  is a neurological condition characterized by changes to certain areas of the  brain. A hallmark of ALSP is leukoencephalopathy, which is the alteration of a  type of brain tissue called white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers  (axons) covered by a substance called myelin that insulates and protects them.  The axons extend from nerve cells (neurons) and transmit nerve impulses  throughout the body. Areas of damage to this brain tissue (white matter lesions)  can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Another feature of ALSP is  swellings called spheroids in the axons of the brain, which are a sign of axon  damage. Also common in ALSP are abnormally pigmented glial cells. Glial cells  are specialized brain cells that protect and maintain neurons. Damage to myelin  and neurons is thought to contribute to many of the neurological signs and  symptoms in people with ALSP. html:p Symptoms of ALSP usually begin in a person's forties and worsen over time.  Personality changes, including  and a loss of  inhibitions, are  among the earliest symptoms of ALSP. Affected individuals may develop memory  loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement  actions and develop problem-solving strategies. Loss of this function impairs  skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, and focusing attention  appropriately. Some people with ALSP have mild , usually only when the  condition begins. As ALSP progresses, it causes a severe decline in thinking and  reasoning abilities (dementia). html:p Over time, motor skills are affected, and people with ALSP may have difficulty  walking. Many develop a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism,  which includes unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), involuntary  (), and muscle stiffness (rigidity). The pattern of cognitive and motor  problems are variable, even among individuals in the same family, although  almost all affected individuals ultimately become unable to walk, speak, and  care for themselves. html:p ALSP was previously thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse  leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic  leukodystrophy (POLD), both of which cause very similar white matter damage and  cognitive and movement problems. POLD was thought to be distinguished by the  presence of pigmented glial cells and an absence of spheroids; however, people  with HDLS can have pigmented cells, too, and people with POLD can have  spheroids. HDLS and POLD are now considered to be part of the same disease  spectrum, which researchers have recommended calling ALSP.

Humans cannot increase the  excretion of iron, although some iron is lost through bleeding or when cells of  the intestine (enterocytes) are shed at the end of the cells' lifespan. Iron  levels in the body are primarily regulated through control of how much iron is  absorbed from the diet. html:p African iron overload results from a diet high in iron. It is particularly  associated with consumption of a traditional African beer that contains  dissolved iron from the metal drums in which it is brewed. Some evidence  suggests that a genetic predisposition to absorbing too much iron may also be  involved. html:p In African iron overload, excess iron typically accumulates primarily in certain  immune cells called reticuloendothelial cells. Reticuloendothelial cells  include macrophages in the bone marrow and spleen and Kupffer cells, which are  specialized macrophages found in the liver that help protect the body against  foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. Later in the course of the  condition, iron also accumulates in liver cells (hepatocytes). This pattern  differs from that seen in a similar iron overload disorder called hereditary  hemochromatosis, in which the excess iron accumulates primarily in the  hepatocytes. html:p When too much iron is absorbed, the resulting iron overload can eventually  damage tissues and organs. Iron overload in the liver can lead to chronic liver  disease (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis increases the risk of developing a type of liver  cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. Iron overload in immune cells may affect  their ability to fight infections. African iron overload is associated with an  increased risk of developing infections such as tuberculosis. The excess iron  also leads to a faster-than-normal breakdown of vitamin C in the body, so  affected individuals are at increased risk of vitamin C deficiency problems such  as scurvy. html:p People with African iron overload may have a slightly low number of red blood  cells (mild anemia), possibly because the iron that accumulates in the liver,  bone marrow, and spleen is less available for production of red blood cells.  Affected individuals also have high levels of a protein called ferritin in their  blood, which can be detected with a blood test. Ferritin stores and releases  iron in cells, and cells produce more ferritin in response to excess amounts of  iron.

Tens of millions of people worldwide are affected. In the United States, an estimated one-third of people over age 65, and half of those over 85, have some hearing loss.
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Age-related hearing loss (also known as presbycusis) is a decrease in hearing  ability that happens with age. In most cases, the hearing loss affects both  ears. It can begin as early as a person's thirties or forties and worsens  gradually over time. html:p Age-related hearing loss first affects the ability to hear high-frequency  sounds, such as . Affected people find it increasingly difficult to  understand what others are saying, particularly when there is background noise  (such as at a party). However, because the hearing loss is gradual, many people  do not realize they cannot hear as well as they used to. They may turn up the  television volume or start speaking louder without being aware of it. html:p As the hearing loss worsens, it affects more frequencies of sound, making it  difficult to hear more than just . Determining where a sound is coming  from (localization) and identifying its source become more challenging. Some  affected individuals also experience a ringing sensation in the ears (tinnitus)  or dizziness and problems with balance (presbystasis). html:p Age-related hearing loss often impacts a person's quality of life. Because  affected individuals have trouble understanding , the condition affects  their ability to communicate. It can contribute to  isolation, ,  and loss of self-esteem. Age-related hearing loss also causes safety issues if  individuals become unable to hear smoke alarms, car horns, and other sounds that  alert people to dangerous situations.

Description1: html  html:p Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of  vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually  becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over  time. html:p Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed  for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision  loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing  cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the  retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area  near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for  central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not  affected, but reduced dim light (scotopic) vision often occurs in the early  stages of the disease. html:p Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration,  known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common,  accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular  degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called  drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The  condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often  occurs in one eye before the other. html:p The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe  vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized  by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These  vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision  appear blurry and distorted.

frequency1: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is a rare disorder. Its exact prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html  html:p Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is a disorder that mainly affects the brain, the  immune system, and the skin. html:p Most newborns with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome do not show any signs or symptoms  of the disorder. However, about 20 percent are born with a combination of  features that include an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly),  elevated blood levels of liver enzymes, a shortage of blood cell fragments  called platelets that are needed for normal blood clotting (thrombocytopenia),  and neurological abnormalities. While this combination of signs and symptoms is  typically associated with the immune system's response to a viral infection that  is present at birth (congenital), no actual infection is found in these  infants. For this reason, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is sometimes referred to as  a"mimic of congenital infection." html:p Within the first year of life, most individuals with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome  experience an episode of severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), typically  lasting for several months. During this encephalopathic phase of the disorder,  affected babies are usually extremely irritable and do not feed well. They may  develop intermittent fevers in the absence of infection (sterile pyrexias) and  may have . They stop developing new skills and begin losing skills they  had already acquired . Growth of the brain and skull  slows down, resulting in an abnormally small head size (microcephaly). In this  phase of the disorder, white blood cells and other immune system molecules  associated with inflammation can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, which  is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).  These abnormal findings are consistent with inflammation and tissue damage in  the central nervous system. html:p The encephalopathic phase of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome causes permanent  neurological damage that is usually severe. Medical imaging reveals loss of  white matter in the brain (leukodystrophy). White matter consists of nerve  fibers covered by myelin, which is a substance that protects nerves and insures  rapid transmission of nerve impulses. Affected individuals also have abnormal  deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain. As a result of this  neurological damage, most people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome have profound  disability. They also have ;  Involuntary , especially those in the arms;  and  () in the torso. html:p Some people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome have features characteristic of  autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and  attacks the body's own systems and organs. Some of these features overlap with  those of another disorder called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A feature  of SLE that also occurs in about 40 percent of people with Aicardi-Goutières  syndrome is a skin problem called chilblains. Chilblains are painful, itchy skin  lesions that are puffy and red, and usually appear on the fingers, toes, and  ears. They are caused by inflammation of small blood vessels, and may be brought  on or made worse by exposure to cold. Vision problems, joint stiffness, and  mouth ulcers are other features that can occur in both disorders. html:p As a result of the severe neurological problems usually associated with  Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, most people with this disorder do not survive past  childhood. However, some affected individuals who develop the condition later or  have milder neurological problems live into adulthood.

frequency1: The estimated prevalence of Alagille syndrome is 1 in 70,000 newborns. This figure is based on diagnoses of liver disease in infants, and may be an underestimation because some people with Alagille syndrome do not develop liver disease during infancy.
Description1: html  html:p Alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect the liver, heart, and  other parts of the body. html:p One of the major features of Alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by  abnormalities in the bile ducts. These ducts carry bile (which helps to digest  fats) from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. In Alagille  syndrome, the bile ducts may be narrow, malformed, and reduced in number (bile  duct paucity). As a result, bile builds up in the liver and causes scarring that  prevents the liver from working properly to eliminate wastes from the  bloodstream. Signs and symptoms arising from liver damage in Alagille syndrome  may include a yellowish tinge in the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice),  itchy skin, and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas). html:p Alagille syndrome is also associated with several heart problems, including  impaired blood flow from the heart into the lungs (pulmonic stenosis). Pulmonic  stenosis may occur along with a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart  (ventricular septal defect) and other heart abnormalities. This combination of  s is called . html:p People with Alagille syndrome may have distinctive facial features including a  broad, prominent forehead; deep-set eyes; and a small, pointed chin. The  disorder may also affect the blood vessels within the brain and spinal cord  (central nervous system) and the kidneys. Affected individuals may have an  unusual butterfly shape of the bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) that can  be seen in an x-ray. html:p Problems associated with Alagille syndrome generally become evident in infancy  or early childhood. The severity of the disorder varies among affected  individuals, even within the same family. Symptoms range from so mild as to go  unnoticed to severe heart and/or liver disease requiring transplantation. html:p Some people with Alagille syndrome may have isolated signs of the disorder, such  as a  like , or a characteristic facial  appearance.

However, the prevalence of aldosterone-producing adenomas is <span style="color:#800000;"><font color="#800000">unknown.</font></span>
Description1: html  html:p An aldosterone-producing adenoma is a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops  in an adrenal gland, which is a small hormone-producing gland located on top of  each kidney. In most cases, individuals develop a single tumor in one of the  adrenal glands. The adrenal tumor produces too much of the hormone aldosterone,  which is a condition known as primary hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone helps  regulate the body's fluid levels and blood pressure by controlling the amount of  salt retained by the kidneys. Excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain  more salt than normal, which increases the body's fluid levels and blood  pressure. People with an aldosterone-producing adenoma may develop severe high  blood pressure (hypertension), and they have an increased risk of heart attack,  stroke, or an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation).

Description1: html  html:p Alexander disease is a rare disorder of the nervous system. It is one of a  group of disorders, called leukodystrophies, that involve the destruction of  myelin. Myelin is the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers and promotes  the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. If myelin is not properly maintained,  the transmission of nerve impulses could be disrupted. As myelin deteriorates  in leukodystrophies such as Alexander disease, nervous system functions are  impaired. html:p Most cases of Alexander disease begin before age 2 and are described as the  infantile form. Signs and symptoms of the infantile form typically include an  enlarged brain and head size (megalencephaly), ,    Less frequently, onset occurs later in childhood (the juvenile form) or in  adulthood. Common problems in juvenile and adult forms of Alexander disease  include  abnormalities, swallowing difficulties, , and  . Rarely, a neonatal form of Alexander disease occurs  within the first month of life and is associated with severe  , a buildup of fluid in the brain  (hydrocephalus), and . html:p Alexander disease is also characterized by abnormal protein deposits known as  Rosenthal fibers. These deposits are found in specialized cells called  astroglial cells, which support and nourish other cells in the brain and spinal  cord (central nervous system).

In the United</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">States, the condition affects an estimated 8 percent of the population. In</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">nearly 90 percent of children and 50 percent of adults with asthma, the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">condition is classified as allergic asthma.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by inflammation of the airways and  recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty. These episodes, sometimes referred  to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways. In  allergic asthma, the attacks occur when substances known as allergens are  inhaled, causing an allergic reaction. Allergens are harmless substances that  the body's immune system mistakenly reacts to as though they are harmful. Common  allergens include pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold. The immune response  leads to the symptoms of asthma. Allergic asthma is the most common form of the  disorder. html:p A hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which means the airways  are especially sensitive to irritants and respond excessively. Because of this  hyperresponsiveness, attacks can be triggered by irritants other than allergens,  such as physical activity, respiratory infections, or exposure to tobacco  smoke, in people with allergic asthma. html:p An asthma attack is characterized by tightening of the muscles around the  airways (bronchoconstriction), which narrows the airway and makes breathing  difficult. Additionally, the immune reaction can lead to swelling of the airways  and overproduction of mucus. During an attack, an affected individual can  experience chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. Over  time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged (hypertrophied),  further narrowing the airways. html:p Some people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay  fever (allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Asthma is sometimes part of a  series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. Development of  these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema (atopic  dermatitis), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma.  However, not all individuals with asthma have progressed through the atopic  march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.

Description1: html  html:p Alport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing  loss, and eye abnormalities. html:p People with Alport syndrome experience progressive loss of kidney function.  Almost all affected individuals have blood in their urine (hematuria), which  indicates abnormal functioning of the kidneys. Many people with Alport syndrome  also develop high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). The kidneys  become less able to function as this condition progresses, resulting in  end-stage renal disease (ESRD). html:p People with Alport syndrome frequently develop sensorineural hearing loss, which  is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear, during late childhood or early  adolescence. Affected individuals may also have misshapen lenses in the eyes  (anterior lenticonus) and abnormal coloration of the light-sensitive tissue at  the back of the eye (retina). These eye abnormalities seldom lead to vision  loss. html:p Significant hearing loss, eye abnormalities, and progressive kidney disease are  more common in males with Alport syndrome than in affected females.

Description1: html  html:p Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by  recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body  (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of  the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes  begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the  paralysis lasts from minutes to days. html:p In addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of  uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements  (choreoathetosis), , movement of the eyes (nystagmus),  or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of  childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual  paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from  episodes of hemiplegia. html:p The episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain  factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing,  although the trigger is not always known. A characteristic feature of  alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the  affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening. The number  and length of the episodes initially worsen throughout childhood but then begin  to decrease over time. The uncontrollable muscle movements may disappear  entirely, but the episodes of hemiplegia occur throughout life. html:p Alternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive  problems. Almost all affected individuals have some level of  . Their cognitive functioning typically declines  over time.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alveolar-capillary-dysplasia-with-misalignment -of-pulmonary-veins
frequency1: ACD/MPV is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Approximately 200 infants with this disorder have been identified worldwide.
Description1: html  html:p Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is a  disorder affecting the development of the lungs and their blood vessels. The  disorder affects the millions of small air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs and the  tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the alveoli. It is through these alveolar  capillaries that inhaled oxygen enters the bloodstream for distribution  throughout the body and carbon dioxide leaves the bloodstream to be exhaled. html:p In ACD/MPV, the alveolar capillaries fail to develop normally. The number of  capillaries is drastically reduced, and existing capillaries are improperly  positioned within the walls of the alveoli. These abnormalities in capillary  number and location impede the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. html:p Other abnormalities of the blood vessels in the lungs also occur in ACD/MPV.  The veins that carry blood from the lungs into the heart (pulmonary veins) are  improperly positioned and may be abnormally bundled together with arteries that  carry blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary arteries). The muscle tissue  in the walls of the pulmonary arteries may be overgrown, resulting in thicker  artery walls and a narrower channel. These changes restrict normal blood flow,  which causes high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary  hypertension) and requires the heart to pump harder. html:p Most infants with ACD/MPV are born with additional abnormalities. These may  include abnormal twisting (malrotation) of the large intestine or other  . Cardiovascular and genitourinary  abnormalities are also common in affected individuals. html:p Infants with ACD/MPV typically develop respiratory distress within a few minutes  to a few hours after birth. They experience shortness of breath and cyanosis,  which is a bluish appearance of the skin, mucous membranes, or the area  underneath the fingernails caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. Without lung  transplantation, infants with ACD/MPV have not been known to survive past one  year of age, and most affected infants live only a few weeks.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Alzheimer disease currently affects an estimated 2.4 million to 4.5 million</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Americans. Because the risk of developing Alzheimer disease increases with age</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">and more people are living longer, the number of people with this disease is</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">expected to increase significantly in coming decades.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Alzheimer disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia,  which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. This  disorder usually appears in people older than age 65, but less common forms of  the disease appear earlier in adulthood. html:p Memory loss is the most common sign of Alzheimer disease. Forgetfulness may be  subtle at first, but the loss of memory worsens over time until it interferes  with most aspects of daily living. Even in familiar settings, a person with  Alzheimer disease may get lost or become confused. Routine tasks such as  preparing meals, doing laundry, and performing other household chores can be  challenging. Additionally, it may become difficult to recognize people and name  objects. Affected people increasingly require help with dressing, eating, and  personal care. html:p As the disorder progresses, some people with Alzheimer disease experience  personality and  changes and have trouble interacting in a ly  appropriate manner. Other common symptoms include agitation, restlessness,  withdrawal, and loss of  skills. People with this disease usually  require total care during the advanced stages of the disease. Affected  individuals usually survive 8 to 10 years after the appearance of symptoms, but  the course of the disease can range from 1 to 25 years. Death usually results  from pneumonia, malnutrition, or general body wasting (inanition). html:p Alzheimer disease can be classified as early-onset or late-onset. The signs and  symptoms of the early-onset form appear before age 65, while the late-onset  form appears after age 65. The early-onset form is much less common than the  late-onset form, accounting for less than 5 percent of all cases of Alzheimer  disease.

ALS-PDC has not been reported outside</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">of these populations.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease that affects motor  neurons, which are specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement. These  nerve cells are found in the spinal cord and the brain. In ALS, motor neurons  die (atrophy) over time, leading to muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and  an inability to control movement. html:p There are many different types of ALS; these types are distinguished by their  signs and symptoms and their genetic cause or lack of clear genetic association.  Most people with ALS have a form of the condition that is described as  sporadic, which means it occurs in people with no apparent history of the  disorder in their family. People with sporadic ALS usually first develop  features of the condition in their late fifties or early sixties. A small  proportion of people with ALS, estimated at 5 to 10 percent, have a family  history of ALS or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia (FTD),  which is a progressive brain disorder that affects personality, behavior, and  . The signs and symptoms of familial ALS typically first appear in one's  late forties or early fifties. Rarely, people with familial ALS develop  symptoms in childhood or their teenage years. These individuals have a rare form  of the disorder known as juvenile ALS. html:p The first signs and symptoms of ALS may be so subtle that they are overlooked.  The earliest symptoms include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or  weakness. Affected individuals may develop slurred  () and,  later, difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia). Many people with ALS  experience malnutrition because of reduced food intake due to dysphagia and an  increase in their body's energy demands (metabolism) due to prolonged illness.  Muscles become weaker as the disease progresses, and arms and legs begin to look  thinner as muscle tissue atrophies. Individuals with ALS eventually lose muscle  strength and the ability to walk. Affected individuals eventually become  wheelchair-dependent and increasingly require help with personal care and other  activities of daily living. Over time, muscle weakness causes affected  individuals to lose the use of their hands and arms. Breathing becomes difficult  because the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. Most people with ALS die  from respiratory failure within 2 to 10 years after the signs and symptoms of  ALS first appear; however, disease progression varies widely among affected  individuals. html:p Approximately 20 percent of individuals with ALS also develop FTD. Changes in  personality and behavior may make it difficult for affected individuals to  interact with others in a ly appropriate manner.  skills  worsen as the disease progresses. It is unclear how the development of ALS and  FTD are related. Individuals who develop both conditions are diagnosed as having  ALS-FTD. html:p A rare form of ALS that often runs in families is known as  ALS-parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS-PDC). This disorder is characterized by  the signs and symptoms of ALS, in addition to a pattern of movement  abnormalities known as parkinsonism, and a progressive loss of  function (dementia).

Description1: html  html:p Anauxetic dysplasia is a disorder characterized by extremely  (dwarfism) and other skeletal abnormalities, an unusually large range of joint  movement (hypermobility), dental problems, and distinctive facial features. Mild  disability can also occur in this disorder. html:p People with anauxetic dysplasia have dwarfism with unusually short limbs for  their height (disproportionate ) beginning before birth.  Dislocation of the bones at the top of the spine (atlantoaxial subluxation) can  also occur in this disorder, and may cause pinching (compression) of the spinal  cord. As a result, affected individuals may experience neurological symptoms  including pain, tingling, numbness, coordination problems, weakness, and  paralysis. In severe cases, the spinal cord compression may lead to paralysis of  the muscles needed for breathing, which can be life-threatening during early  childhood. html:p Other skeletal abnormalities in anauxetic dysplasia include a barrel-shaped  chest and a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis).  Without surgical correction, the kyphoscoliosis can constrict the lungs and  cause difficulty breathing. People with anauxetic dysplasia can also have an  exaggerated curvature of the lower back (hyperlordosis), dislocation of the  hips, and soles of the feet that are rounded outward (rocker-bottom feet). html:p Typical facial features in anauxetic dysplasia include closely spaced eyes  (hypotelorism),  ), an unusually large tongue (macroglossia), and a protruding chin  (prognathism). Affected individuals can also have fewer teeth than normal  (hypodontia).

frequency1: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome affects 2 to 5 per 100,000 people who are genetically male. Partial androgen insensitivity is thought to be at least as common as complete androgen insensitivity. Mild androgen insensitivity is much less common.
Description1: html  html:p Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development  before birth and during puberty. People with this condition are genetically  male, with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Because their  bodies are unable to respond to certain male sex hormones (called androgens),  they may have mostly female external sex characteristics or signs of both male  and female sexual development. html:p Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome occurs when the body cannot use  androgens at all. People with this form of the condition have the external sex  characteristics of females, but do not have a uterus and therefore do not  menstruate and are unable to conceive a child (infertile). They are typically  raised as females and have a female gender identity. Affected individuals have  male internal sex organs (testes) that are undescended, which means they are  abnormally located in the pelvis or abdomen. Undescended testes have a small  chance of becoming cancerous later in life if they are not surgically removed.  People with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome also have sparse or absent  hair in the pubic area and under the arms. html:p The partial and mild forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome result when the  body's tissues are partially sensitive to the effects of androgens. People with  partial androgen insensitivity (also called Reifenstein syndrome) can have  genitalia that look typically female, genitalia that have both male and female  characteristics, or genitalia that look typically male. They may be raised as  males or as females and may have a male or a female gender identity. People  with mild androgen insensitivity are born with male sex characteristics, but  they are often infertile and tend to experience breast enlargement at puberty.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Androgenetic alopecia is a common form of hair loss in both men and women. In  men, this condition is also known as male-pattern baldness. Hair is lost in a  well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Over time, the hairline  recedes to form a characteristic"M"shape. Hair also thins at the crown (near  the top of the head), often progressing to partial or complete baldness. html:p The pattern of hair loss in women differs from male-pattern baldness. In women,  the hair becomes thinner all over the head, and the hairline does not recede.  Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness. html:p Androgenetic alopecia in men has been associated with several other medical  conditions including coronary heart disease and enlargement of the prostate.  Additionally, prostate cancer, disorders of insulin resistance (such as diabetes  and obesity), and high blood pressure (hypertension) have been related to  androgenetic alopecia. In women, this form of hair loss is associated with an  increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by a  hormonal imbalance that can lead to irregular menstruation, acne, excess hair  elsewhere on the body (hirsutism), and weight gain.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Anencephaly is a condition that prevents the normal development of the brain and  the bones of the skull. This condition results when a structure called the  neural tube fails to close during the first few weeks of embryonic development.  The neural tube is a layer of cells that ultimately develops into the brain and  spinal cord. Because anencephaly is caused by abnormalities of the neural tube,  it is classified as a neural tube defect. html:p Because the neural tube fails to close properly, the developing brain and spinal  cord are exposed to the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus in the womb.  This exposure causes the nervous system tissue to break down (degenerate). As a  result, people with anencephaly are missing large parts of the brain called the  cerebrum and cerebellum. These brain regions are necessary for thinking,  hearing, vision, emotion, and . The bones of the skull are  also missing or incompletely formed. html:p Because these nervous system abnormalities are so severe, almost all babies with  anencephaly die before birth or within a few hours or days after birth.

frequency1: The prevalence of the X-linked recessive type of EDA-ID is estimated to be 1 in 250,000 individuals. Only a few cases of the autosomal dominant form have been described in the scientific literature.
Description1: html  html:p Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (EDA-ID) is a form of  ectodermal dysplasia, which is a group of conditions characterized by    . In addition, immune system function is reduced in people with EDA-ID.  The signs and symptoms of EDA-ID are evident soon after birth, and due to the  severity of the immune system problems, most people with this condition survive  only into childhood. html:p Skin abnormalities in children with EDA-ID include areas that are dry, wrinkled,  or darker in color than the surrounding skin. Affected individuals tend to have  sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis). EDA-ID is also characterized by  missing teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are small and pointed. Most children  with EDA-ID have a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis) because they have  fewer sweat glands than normal or their sweat glands do not function properly.  An inability to sweat (anhidrosis) can lead to a dangerously high body  temperature (hyperthermia), particularly in hot weather and during exercise,  because the body cannot cool itself by evaporating sweat. html:p The immune deficiency in EDA-ID varies among individuals with this condition.  Children with EDA-ID often produce abnormally low levels of proteins called  antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies help protect the body against  infection by attaching to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for  destruction. A reduction in antibodies makes it difficult for children with  this disorder to fight off infections. In EDA-ID, immune system cells called T  cells and B cells have a decreased ability to recognize and respond to foreign  invaders (such as bacteria, viruses, and yeast) that have sugar molecules  attached to their surface (glycan antigens). Other key aspects of the immune  system may also be impaired, leading to recurrent infections. html:p Children with EDA-ID commonly get infections in the lungs (pneumonia), ears  (otitis media), sinuses (sinusitis), lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), skin, bones,  and gastrointestinal tract. Approximately one quarter of individuals with EDA-ID  have disorders involving abnormal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel  disease or rheumatoid arthritis. html:p There are two forms of EDA-ID that have similar signs and symptoms and are  distinguished by the modes of inheritance: X-linked recessive or autosomal  dominant.

Description1: html  html:p Aniridia is an eye disorder characterized by a complete or partial absence of  the colored part of the eye (the iris). These iris abnormalities may cause the  pupils to be abnormal or misshapen. Aniridia can cause reduction in the  sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light  (photophobia). html:p People with aniridia can also have other eye problems. Increased pressure in  the eye (glaucoma) typically appears in late childhood or early adolescence.  Clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts), occur in 50 percent to 85 percent  of people with aniridia. In about 10 percent of affected people, the structures  that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves) are  underdeveloped. Individuals with aniridia may also have involuntary eye  movements (nystagmus) or  . Many of these eye  problems contribute to progressive vision loss in affected individuals. The  severity of symptoms is typically the same in both eyes. html:p Rarely, people with aniridia have  problems,  and  problems detecting odors.

Description1: html  html:p Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome is a form of  ectodermal dysplasia, a group of about 150 conditions characterized by    sweat glands. html:p Among the most common features of AEC syndrome are missing patches of skin  (erosions). In affected infants, skin erosions most commonly occur on the scalp.  They tend to recur throughout childhood and into adulthood, frequently  affecting the scalp, neck, hands, and feet. The skin erosions range from mild to  severe and can lead to infection, scarring, and hair loss. Other ectodermal  abnormalities in AEC syndrome include changes in skin coloring; brittle, sparse,  or missing hair; misshapen or absent fingernails and toenails; and malformed or  missing teeth. Affected individuals also report increased sensitivity to heat  and a reduced ability to sweat. html:p Many infants with AEC syndrome are born with an eyelid condition known as  ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, in which strands of tissue partially or  completely fuse the upper and lower eyelids. Most people with AEC syndrome are  also born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), a split in  the lip (a cleft lip), or both. Cleft lip or cleft palate can make it difficult  for affected infants to suck, so these infants often have trouble feeding and do  not grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). html:p Additional features of AEC syndrome can include limb abnormalities, most  commonly fused fingers and toes (syndactyly). Less often, affected individuals  have permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly) or a deep split in the  hands or feet with missing fingers or toes and fusion of the remaining digits  (ectrodactyly). Hearing loss is common, occurring in more than 90 percent of  children with AEC syndrome. Some affected individuals have distinctive facial  features, such as small jaws that cannot open fully and a narrow space between  the upper lip and nose (philtrum). Other signs and symptoms can include the  in affected  males, digestive problems, absent tear duct openings in the eyes, and chronic  sinus or ear infections. html:p A condition known as Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome has signs and symptoms that overlap  considerably with those of AEC syndrome. These two syndromes were classified as  separate disorders until it was discovered that they both result from mutations  in the same part of the same gene. Most researchers now consider Rapp-Hodgkin  syndrome and AEC syndrome to be part of the same disease spectrum.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ankyrin-b-syndrome
frequency1: Ankyrin-B syndrome is a rare disorder. Its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html  html:p Ankyrin-B syndrome is associated with a variety of heart problems related to  disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia). Heart rhythm is controlled  by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way.  In ankyrin-B syndrome, disruption of different steps of electrical signaling can  lead to arrhythmia, and the resulting heart problems vary among affected  individuals. html:p Individuals with ankyrin-B syndrome may have problems with the sinoatrial (SA)  node, which generates the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat. If the  SA node is not functioning properly, the heartbeat can be too slow  (bradycardia). In a small number of people with ankyrin-B syndrome, the heart  takes longer than usual to recharge between beats, which is known as a prolonged  QT interval (long QT). Some affected individuals have impaired progression  (conduction) of electrical impulses between the chambers of the heart, which can  cause a problem called heart block. Other heart problems that occur in  ankyrin-B syndrome include irregular and uncoordinated electrical activity in  the heart's upper chambers (atrial fibrillation) or lower chambers (ventricular  fibrillation) and an abnormality called catecholaminergic polymorphic  ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), in which an increase in the heart rate can  trigger an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat called ventricular  tachycardia. In people with ankyrin-B syndrome, arrhythmia can lead to fainting  (syncope) or cardiac arrest and sudden death. html:p When associated with a prolonged QT interval, the condition is sometimes  classified as long QT syndrome 4. However, because additional heart problems can  result from changes in the same gene, long QT syndrome 4 is usually considered  part of ankyrin-B syndrome.

It is estimated that 20 percent of individuals</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">younger than age 50 who have a stroke have antiphospholipid syndrome. Ten to 15</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">percent of people with systemic lupus erythematosus have antiphospholipid</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">syndrome. Similarly, 10 to 15 percent of women with recurrent miscarriages</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">likely have this condition. Approximately 70 percent of individuals diagnosed</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">with antiphospholipid syndrome are female.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency  to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This  clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the  thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body, but most  frequently occur in the vessels of the lower limbs. If a blood clot forms in the  vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke.  Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur  when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. html:p Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications  during pregnancy. These complications include pregnancy-induced high blood  pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency),  early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). In addition, women with  antiphospholipid syndrome are at greater risk of having a thrombosis during  pregnancy than at other times during their lives. At birth, infants of mothers  with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight. html:p A thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of  antiphospholipid syndrome. This condition usually appears in early to  mid-adulthood but can begin at any age. html:p Other signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells  and vessels include a reduced amount of cell fragments involved in blood  clotting called platelets (thrombocytopenia), a shortage of red blood cells  (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis), and a purplish skin  discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood  vessels of the skin. In addition, affected individuals may have open sores  (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, heart disease, or  disability. Many people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other  autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. html:p Rarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple  blood vessels throughout their body. These thromboses block blood flow in  affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ  failure. These individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid  syndrome (CAPS). CAPS typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and  liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals. Less than 1 percent of  individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome develop CAPS.

frequency1: AADC deficiency is a rare disorder. Only about 100 people with this condition have been described in the medical literature worldwide; about 20 percent of these individuals are from Taiwan.
Description1: html  html:p Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is an inherited disorder  that affects the way signals are passed between certain cells in the nervous  system. html:p Signs and symptoms of AADC deficiency generally appear in the first year of  life. Affected infants may have severe  (), muscle stiffness, difficulty moving, and involuntary writhing  movements of the limbs (athetosis). They may be lacking in energy (lethargic),  feed poorly, startle easily, and have sleep disturbances. People with AADC  deficiency may also experience episodes called oculogyric crises that involve  abnormal rotation of the eyeballs; extreme irritability and agitation; and pain,  muscle spasms, and uncontrolled movements, especially of the head and neck. html:p AADC deficiency may affect the autonomic nervous system, which controls  involuntary body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body  temperature. Resulting signs and symptoms can include droopy eyelids (ptosis),  constriction of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), inappropriate or impaired  sweating, nasal congestion, drooling, reduced ability to control body  temperature, low blood pressure (hypotension), backflow of acidic stomach  contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux), low blood sugar  (hypoglycemia), fainting (syncope), and cardiac arrest. html:p Signs and symptoms of AADC deficiency tend to worsen late in the day or when the  individual is tired, and improve after sleep.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a form of heart  disease that usually appears in adulthood. ARVC is a disorder of the myocardium,  which is the muscular wall of the heart. This condition causes part of the  myocardium to break down over time, increasing the risk of an abnormal heartbeat  (arrhythmia) and sudden death. html:p ARVC may not cause any symptoms in its early stages. However, affected  individuals may still be at risk of sudden death, especially during strenuous  exercise. When symptoms occur, they most commonly include a sensation of  fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), light-headedness, and  fainting (syncope). Over time, ARVC can also cause shortness of breath and  abnormal swelling in the legs or abdomen. If the myocardium becomes severely  damaged in the later stages of the disease, it can lead to heart failure.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/arterial-tortuosity-syndrome
frequency1: Arterial tortuosity syndrome is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. About 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html  html:p Arterial tortuosity syndrome is a disorder that affects connective tissue.  Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the  body, including blood vessels, skin, joints, and the gastrointestinal tract. html:p As its name suggests, arterial tortuosity syndrome is characterized by blood  vessel abnormalities, particularly abnormal twists and turns (tortuosity) of the  blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the  arteries). Tortuosity arises from abnormal elongation of the arteries; since the  end points of the arteries are fixed, the extra length twists and curves. Other  blood vessel abnormalities that may occur in this disorder include constriction  (stenosis) and abnormal bulging (aneurysm) of vessels, as well as small  clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectasia). html:p Complications resulting from the abnormal arteries can be life-threatening.  Rupture of an aneurysm or sudden tearing (dissection) of the layers in an  arterial wall can result in massive loss of blood from the circulatory system.  Blockage of blood flow to vital organs such as the heart, lungs, or brain can  lead to heart attacks, respiratory problems, and strokes. Stenosis of the  arteries forces the heart to work harder to pump blood and may lead to heart  failure. As a result of these complications, arterial tortuosity syndrome is  often fatal in childhood, although some individuals with mild cases of the  disorder live into adulthood. html:p Features of arterial tortuosity syndrome outside the circulatory system are  caused by abnormal connective tissue in other parts of the body. These features  or that  Have , and unusually soft and  stretchable skin. Some affected individuals have long, slender fingers and toes  (arachnodactyly); curvature of the spine (scoliosis); or a chest that is either  sunken (pectus excavatum) or protruding (pectus carinatum). They may have  protrusion of organs through gaps in muscles (hernias), elongation of the  intestines, or pouches called diverticula in the intestinal walls. html:p People with arterial tortuosity syndrome often look older than their age and  have distinctive facial features including a long, narrow face with droopy  cheeks; eye openings that are narrowed (blepharophimosis) with outside corners  that point downward (downslanting palpebral fissures); a beaked nose with soft  cartilage; a high, arched roof of the mouth (palate); a small lower jaw  (micrognathia); and large ears. The cornea, which is the clear front covering of  the eye, may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin (keratoconus).

Adults with  aspartylglucosaminuria may develop  or problems with movement. html:p People with this condition may also have bones that become progressively weak  and prone to fracture (osteoporosis), an unusually large range of joint movement  (hypermobility), and loose skin. Affected individuals tend to have a  characteristic facial appearance that includes widely spaced eyes (ocular  hypertelorism), small ears, and full lips. The nose is short and broad and the  face is usually square-shaped. Children with this condition may be tall for  their age, but lack of a growth spurt in puberty typically causes adults to be  short. Affected children also tend to have frequent upper respiratory  infections. Individuals with aspartylglucosaminuria usually survive into  mid-adulthood.

Description1: html  html:p Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, also known as Jeune syndrome, is an inherited  disorder of bone growth characterized by a narrow chest, short ribs, shortened  bones in the arms and legs, , and extra fingers and toes  (polydactyly). Additional skeletal abnormalities can include unusually shaped  collarbones (clavicles) and pelvic bones, and and cone-shaped ends of the long  bones in the arms and legs. Many infants with this condition are born with an  extremely narrow, bell-shaped chest that can restrict the growth and expansion  of the lungs. Life-threatening problems with breathing result, and people with  asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy may live only into infancy or early childhood.  However, in people who survive beyond the first few years, the narrow chest and  related breathing problems can improve with age. html:p Some people with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy are born with less severe  skeletal abnormalities and have only mild breathing difficulties, such as rapid  breathing or shortness of breath. These individuals may live into adolescence or  adulthood. After infancy, people with this condition may develop  life-threatening kidney (renal) abnormalities that cause the kidneys to  malfunction or fail. s and a narrowing of the airway (subglottic  stenosis) are also possible. Other, less common features of asphyxiating  thoracic dystrophy include liver disease, fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the  pancreas, dental abnormalities, and an eye disease called retinal dystrophy that  can lead to vision loss.

Description1: html  html:p Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome is a rare condition that affects the part of the  brain that coordinates movement (the cerebellum) and blood-forming cells in the  bone marrow. The age when signs and symptoms begin, the severity of the  condition, and the rate at which it worsens all vary among affected individuals. html:p People with ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome have neurological problems associated  with a loss of tissue (atrophy) and other changes in the cerebellum. These  problems include , difficulty with  movements that involve judging distance or scale (dysmetria), uncontrollable  muscle contractions (clonus), and involuntary back-and-forth eye movements  (nystagmus). These neurological issues worsen over time, making walking and  other movements challenging. Some affected individuals eventually require  wheelchair assistance. html:p Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome also causes a shortage of one or more types of  normal blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A  shortage of all three of these cell types is known as pancytopenia. Pancytopenia  can result in extreme tiredness (fatigue) due to low numbers of red blood cells  (anemia), frequent infections due to low numbers of white blood cells  (neutropenia), and abnormal bleeding due to low numbers of platelets  (thrombocytopenia). Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome is also associated with an  increased risk of certain cancerous conditions of the blood, particularly  myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.

Description1: html  html:p Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia is a condition characterized by progressive  problems with movement. The hallmark of this condition is difficulty  , which is often the first symptom. Most affected  people also have oculomotor apraxia, which makes it difficult to move their  eyes side-to-side. People with oculomotor apraxia have to turn their head to see  things in their side (peripheral) vision. html:p There are multiple types of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. The types are very  similar but are caused by mutations in different genes. The two most common  types (types 1 and 2) share features, in addition to ataxia and oculomotor  apraxia, that include involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches  (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). In type 1, ataxia  beings around age 4; in type 2, ataxia begins around age 15. Chorea and  myoclonus tend to disappear gradually in type 1; these movement problems persist  throughout life in type 2. Individuals with type 1 often develop wasting  (atrophy) in their hands and feet, which further impairs movement. Nearly all  individuals with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia develop neuropathy, which leads  to absent reflexes and weakness. Neuropathy causes many individuals with this  condition to require wheelchair assistance, typically 10 to 15 years after the  start of movement problems. Intelligence is usually not affected by this  condition, but some people have  disability. html:p People with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 tend to have decreased amounts  of a protein called albumin, which transports molecules in the blood. This  decrease in albumin likely causes an increase in the amount of cholesterol  circulating in the bloodstream. Increased cholesterol levels may raise a  person's risk of developing heart disease. People with ataxia with oculomotor  apraxia type 2 have increased blood cholesterol, but they have normal albumin  levels. Individuals with type 2 tend to have high amounts of a protein called  alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in their blood. (An increase in the level of this  protein is normally seen in the bloodstream of pregnant women.) Affected  individuals may also have high amounts of a protein called creatine  phosphokinase (CPK) in their blood. This protein is found mainly in muscle  tissue. The effect of abnormally high levels of AFP or CPK in people with ataxia  with oculomotor apraxia type 2 is unknown.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Atopic dermatitis is a common disorder that affects 10 to 20 percent of</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">children and 5 to 10 percent of adults.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p Atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema) is a disorder characterized by  inflammation of the skin (dermatitis). The condition usually begins in early  infancy, and it often disappears before adolescence. However, in some affected  individuals the condition continues into adulthood; in others, it does not begin  until adulthood. Hallmarks of atopic dermatitis include dry, itchy skin and red  rashes that come and go. The rashes can occur on any part of the body, although  the pattern tends to be different at different ages. In affected infants, the  rashes commonly occur on the face, scalp, hands, and feet. In children, the  rashes are usually found in the bend of the elbows and knees and on the front of  the neck. In adolescents and adults, the rashes typically occur on the wrists,  ankles, and eyelids in addition to the bend of the elbows and knees. Scratching  the itchy skin can lead to oozing and crusting of the rashes and thickening and  hardening (lichenification) of the skin. The itchiness can be so severe as to  disturb sleep and impair a person's quality of life. html:p The word"atopic"indicates an association with allergies. While atopic  dermatitis is not always due to an allergic reaction, it is commonly associated  with other allergic disorders: up to 60 percent of people with atopic dermatitis  develop asthma or hay fever (allergic rhinitis) later in life, and up to 30  percent have food allergies. Atopic dermatitis is often the beginning of a  series of allergic disorders, referred to as the"atopic march."Development of  these disorders typically follows a pattern, beginning with atopic dermatitis,  followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma. However, not all  individuals with atopic dermatitis will progress through the atopic march, and  not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others. html:p Individuals with atopic dermatitis have an increased risk of developing other  conditions related to inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease,  rheumatoid arthritis, and hair loss caused by a malfunctioning immune reaction  (alopecia areata). They also have an increased risk of having a  or  disorder, such as  () or  . html:p In a particular subset of individuals with atopic dermatitis, the immune system  is unable to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi  (which is known as immunodeficiency). These individuals are prone to recurrent  infections. Most also have other allergic disorders, such as asthma, hay fever,  and food allergies. html:p Atopic dermatitis can also be a feature of separate disorders that have a number  of signs and symptoms, which can include skin abnormalities and  immunodeficiency. Some such disorders are Netherton syndrome; immune  dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome; and  severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome.

Name1: Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/atypical-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome
frequency1: The incidence of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 500,000 people per year in the United States. The atypical form is probably about 10 times less common than the typical form.
Description1: html  html:p Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disease that primarily affects kidney  function. This condition, which can occur at any age, causes abnormal blood  clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can  cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. Atypical  hemolytic-uremic syndrome is characterized by three major features related to  abnormal clotting: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. html:p Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis)  prematurely. In atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, red blood cells can break  apart as they squeeze past clots within small blood vessels. Anemia results if  these cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This condition  can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin  (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. html:p Thrombocytopenia is a reduced level of circulating platelets, which are cell  fragments that normally assist with blood clotting. In people with atypical  hemolytic-uremic syndrome, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream  because a large number of platelets are used to make abnormal clots.  Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. html:p As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with atypical  hemolytic-uremic syndrome experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that  lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about half of all cases. These  life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering fluids and  waste products from the body effectively. html:p Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be distinguished from a more common  condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have  different causes and different signs and symptoms. Unlike the atypical form, the  typical form is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli  bacteria that produce toxic substances called Shiga-like toxins. The typical  form is characterized by severe diarrhea and most often affects children younger  than 10. The typical form is less likely than the atypical form to involve  recurrent attacks of kidney damage that lead to ESRD.

Some affected individuals  also have . html:p Abnormalities of the mandible are another characteristic feature of  auriculo-condylar syndrome. These abnormalities often include an unusually small  chin (micrognathia) and malfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which  connects the lower jaw to the skull. Problems with the TMJ affect how the upper  and lower jaws fit together and can make it difficult to open and close the  mouth. The term"condylar"in the name of the condition refers to the mandibular  condyle, which is the upper portion of the mandible that forms part of the TMJ. html:p Other features of auriculo-condylar syndrome can include prominent cheeks, an  unusually small mouth (microstomia), differences in the size and shape of facial  structures between the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry), and  an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). These features vary, even  among affected members of the same family. <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html</span>  html:p () is a condition that appears very early in  childhood development, varies in severity, and is characterized by  .

Affected individuals have difficulty understanding and using non-verbal  cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body  . Inability to recognize and use these cues makes it hard for affected  individuals to understand the feelings of others or communicate their own  feelings appropriately.  signs of , such as reduced eye contact and  interaction, can sometimes be detected before age 2. However, the  condition is usually diagnosed between ages 2 and 4, when more advanced  and  skills, such as  to play with others, typically  begin to develop. html:p Repetitive behaviors in  can include simple actions such as rocking,  hand-flapping, or repetition of words or noises (echolalia). Affected  individuals often dwell on or repeatedly express particular thoughts; this  behavior is called perseveration. People with  tend to be rigid about their  established routines and may strongly resist disruptions such as changes in  schedule. They may also have difficulty tolerating sensory stimuli such as loud  noises or bright lights. html:p While  and  difficulties and unusual behaviors define ,  affected individuals can have a wide range of  abilities and  skills. A majority of people with  have mild to moderate  disability, while others have average to above-average  intelligence.

For example, autistic disorder was  a term that was used when affected individuals had limited or absent verbal  , often in combination with  disability. By contrast,  Asperger syndrome was a diagnosis formerly applied to affected individuals of  average or above-average intelligence who were not delayed in their  development. The broader diagnosis of  was established because many affected  individuals fall outside of the strict definitions of the narrower diagnoses,  and their  and  abilities may change over time.  However, some individuals who were previously diagnosed with one of the subtypes  now do not meet all the criteria of the new umbrella diagnosis.

Description1: html  html:p Autoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are  small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified  as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system  that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several  hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems. html:p The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time,  although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of  this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite,  and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure  (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle  cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune  Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially  in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows,  knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also  be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development  of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may   html:p Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of  sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium  (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of  red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells  (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia). html:p Autoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis,  characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe  hypotension leading to shock. The adrenal crisis is often triggered by a  stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection. html:p Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members can have  another autoimmune disorder, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1  diabetes.

frequency1: ALPS is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. More than 200 affected individuals have been identified worldwide.
Description1: html  html:p Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited disorder in which  the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells  (lymphocytes). ALPS is characterized by the production of an abnormally large  number of lymphocytes (lymphoproliferation). Accumulation of excess lymphocytes  results in enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), the liver  (hepatomegaly), and the spleen (splenomegaly). html:p People with ALPS have an increased risk of developing cancer of the immune  system cells (lymphoma) and may also be at increased risk of developing other  cancers. html:p Autoimmune disorders are also common in ALPS. Autoimmune disorders occur when  the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.  Most of the autoimmune disorders associated with ALPS target and damage blood  cells. For example, the immune system may attack red blood cells (autoimmune  hemolytic anemia), white blood cells (autoimmune neutropenia), or platelets  (autoimmune thrombocytopenia). Less commonly, autoimmune disorders that affect  other organs and tissues occur in people with ALPS. These disorders can damage  the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), liver (autoimmune hepatitis), eyes (uveitis),  nerves (Guillain-Barre syndrome), or the connective tissues (systemic lupus  erythematosus) that provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout  the body. html:p Skin problems, usually rashes or hives (urticaria), can occur in ALPS.  Occasionally, affected individuals develop hardened skin with painful lumps or  patches (panniculitis). Other rare signs and symptoms of ALPS include joint  inflammation (arthritis), inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), mouth  sores (oral ulcers), or an early loss of ovarian function (premature ovarian  failure) may also occur in this disorder. Affected individuals can also develop  neurological damage (organic brain syndrome) with symptoms that may include  headaches, , or a decline in  functions (dementia). html:p ALPS can have different patterns of signs and symptoms, which are sometimes  considered separate forms of the disorder. In the most common form,  lymphoproliferation generally becomes apparent during childhood. Enlargement of  the lymph nodes and spleen frequently occur in affected individuals. Autoimmune  disorders typically develop several years later, most frequently as a  combination of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, also called Evans  syndrome. People with this classic form of ALPS have a greatly increased risk of  developing lymphoma compared with the general population. html:p Other types of ALPS are very rare. In some affected individuals, severe  lymphoproliferation begins around the time of birth, and autoimmune disorders  and lymphoma develop at an early age. People with this pattern of signs and  symptoms generally do not live beyond childhood. Another form of ALPS involves  lymphoproliferation and the tendency to develop systemic lupus erythematosus.  Individuals with this form of the disorder do not have an enlarged spleen. html:p Some people have signs and symptoms that resemble those of ALPS, but the  specific pattern of these signs and symptoms or the genetic cause may be  different than in other forms. Researchers disagree whether individuals with  these non-classic forms should be considered to have ALPS or a separate  condition.

frequency1: APECED occurs in about 1 in 90,000 to 200,000 people in most populations studied, which have been mainly in Europe. This condition occurs more frequently in certain populations, affecting about 1 in 9,000 to 25,000 people among Iranian Jews, Sardinians, and Finns.
Description1: html  html:p Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is an  inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. It is one of many  autoimmune diseases, which are disorders that occur when the immune system  malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs by mistake. html:p In most cases, the signs and symptoms of APECED begin in childhood or  adolescence. This condition commonly involves three characteristic features:  chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal gland  insufficiency. Affected individuals typically have at least two of these  features, and many have all three. html:p CMC is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist  html:i  Candida           html:p Other features of APECED result from the body's immune system attacking the  network of hormone-producing glands (the endocrine system). The second  characteristic feature of the disorder is hypoparathyroidism, which is a  malfunction of the parathyroid glands. These glands secrete a hormone that  regulates the body's use of calcium and phosphorus. Damage to the parathyroid  glands leads to reduced parathyroid hormone production (hypoparathyroidism).  Hypoparathyroidism can cause a tingling sensation in the lips, fingers, and  toes; muscle pain and cramping; weakness; and fatigue. html:p Damage to the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal  glands) results in a third major feature of APECED, adrenal gland insufficiency  (Addison disease). Reduced hormone production by the adrenal glands leads to  signs and symptoms that can include fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite,  weight loss, low blood pressure, and changes in skin coloring. Other endocrine  problems that can occur in APECED include type 1 diabetes resulting from  impaired production of the hormone insulin; a shortage of growth hormone leading  to ; problems affecting the internal reproductive organs (ovaries  or testes) that can cause inability to conceive children (infertility); and  dysfunction of the thyroid gland (a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck),  which can result in many symptoms including weight gain and fatigue. html:p Autoimmune problems affecting non-endocrine tissues can lead to a variety of  additional signs and symptoms in people with APECED. These features occur more  often in North American populations than in European populations. Rashes that  resemble hives (urticarial eruptions) are common and often occur in infancy and  early childhood. Other early signs and symptoms may include  and chronic diarrhea or constipation associated with  difficulty in absorbing nutrients from food. Additional features that occur in  people with APECED, many of which can lead to permanent organ and tissue damage  if left untreated, include stomach irritation (gastritis), liver inflammation  (hepatitis), lung irritation (pneumonitis), dry mouth and dry eyes (Sjogren-like  syndrome), inflammation of the eyes (keratitis), kidney problems (nephritis),  vitamin B12 deficiency, hair loss (alopecia), loss of skin color in blotches  (vitiligo), high blood pressure (hypertension), or a small (atrophic) or absent  spleen (asplenia).

Description1: html  html:p Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCADN) is a  nervous system disorder with signs and symptoms that usually begin in  mid-adulthood and gradually get worse. html:p People with ADCADN have difficulty s  and mild to  moderate hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural  deafness). Most have excessive daytime sleepiness (narcolepsy). Narcolepsy is  typically accompanied by cataplexy, which is a sudden brief loss of muscle tone  in response to strong emotion (such as excitement, surprise, or anger). These  episodes of muscle weakness can cause an affected person to slump over or fall,  which occasionally leads to injury. These characteristic signs and symptoms of  ADCADN typically begin in a person's thirties. html:p Eventually, people with ADCADN also experience a decline of  function (dementia). The cognitive problems often begin with impairment of  executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and  develop problem-solving strategies. Other features that can occur as the  condition worsens include degeneration of the nerves that carry information from  the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy); clouding of the lenses of the eyes  (cataracts); numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory  neuropathy); puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the limbs; an inability to  control the bowels or the flow of urine (incontinence); ;  uncontrollable crying or laughing (pseudobulbar signs); or a distorted view of  reality (psychosis). Affected individuals usually survive into their forties or  fifties.

frequency1: This condition is rare, affecting fewer than 1 per million people.
Description1: html  html:p Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), also known as Job syndrome, is  a condition that affects several body systems, particularly the immune system.  Recurrent infections are common in people with this condition. Affected  individuals tend to have frequent bouts of pneumonia, which are caused by  certain kinds of bacteria that infect the lungs and cause inflammation. These  infections often result in the formation of air-filled cysts (pneumatoceles) in  the lungs. Recurrent skin infections and an inflammatory skin disorder called  eczema are also very common in AD-HIES. These skin problems cause rashes,  blisters, accumulations of pus (abscesses), open sores, and scaling. html:p AD-HIES is characterized by abnormally high levels of an immune system protein  called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood. IgE normally triggers an immune  response against foreign invaders in the body, particularly parasitic worms, and  plays a role in allergies. It is unclear why people with AD-HIES have such high  levels of IgE. html:p AD-HIES also affects other parts of the body, including the bones and teeth.  Many people with AD-HIES have skeletal abnormalities such as an unusually large  range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), an abnormal curvature of the spine  (scoliosis), reduced bone density (osteopenia), and a tendency for bones to  fracture easily. Dental abnormalities are also common in this condition. The  primary (baby) teeth do not fall out at the usual time during childhood but are  retained as the adult teeth grow in. Other signs and symptoms of AD-HIES can  include abnormalities of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle  (coronary arteries), distinctive facial features, and structural abnormalities  of the brain, which do not affect a person's intelligence.

frequency1: The prevalence of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is unknown. The condition is likely underdiagnosed because it often causes no signs or symptoms.
Description1: html  html:p Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is characterized by low levels of calcium in the  blood (hypocalcemia). Affected individuals can have an imbalance of other  molecules in the blood as well, including too much phosphate (hyperphosphatemia)  or too little magnesium (hypomagnesemia). Some people with autosomal dominant  hypocalcemia also have low levels of a hormone called parathyroid hormone  (hypoparathyroidism). This hormone is involved in the regulation of calcium  levels in the blood. Abnormal levels of calcium and other molecules in the body  can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, although about half of affected  individuals have no associated health problems. html:p The most common features of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia include muscle  spasms in the hands and feet (carpopedal spasms) and muscle cramping, prickling  or tingling sensations (paresthesias), or twitching of the nerves and muscles  (neuromuscular irritability) in various parts of the body. More severely  affected individuals develop , usually in infancy or childhood.  Sometimes, these symptoms occur only during episodes of illness or fever. html:p Some people with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia have high levels of calcium in  their urine (hypercalciuria), which can lead to deposits of calcium in the  kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) or the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis).  These conditions can damage the kidneys and impair their function. Sometimes,  abnormal deposits of calcium form in the brain, typically in structures called  basal ganglia, which help control movement. html:p A small percentage of severely affected individuals have features of a kidney  disorder called Bartter syndrome in addition to hypocalcemia. These features can  include a shortage of potassium (hypokalemia) and magnesium and a buildup of  the hormone aldosterone (hyperaldosteronism) in the blood. The abnormal balance  of molecules can raise the pH of the blood, which is known as metabolic  alkalosis. The combination of features of these two conditions is sometimes  referred to as autosomal dominant hypocalcemia with Bartter syndrome or Bartter  syndrome type V. html:p There are two types of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia distinguished by their  genetic cause. The signs and symptoms of the two types are generally the same.

Description1: html  html:p Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy with autonomic disease (ADLD) is one of a  group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies are  characterized by abnormalities of the nervous system's white matter, which  consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin  insulates and protects nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve  impulses. html:p People with ADLD develop signs and symptoms of the condition in adulthood,  typically in their forties or fifties. The first signs of the condition often  involve problems with the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary  body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature.  These problems include difficulty with bowel and bladder function, a sharp drop  in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension), and erectile  dysfunction in men. Rarely, people experience an inability to sweat  (anhidrosis), which can lead to a dangerously high body temperature. html:p In ADLD, movement difficulties often develop after the autonomic nervous system  problems. Affected individuals can have or  weakness and , called  because it  worsens during movement. People with ADLD often have difficulty  , including movements that involve judging distance or scale  (dysmetria), such as picking up a distant object, and rapidly alternating  movements (dysdiadochokinesis), including hand clapping or foot stomping. These  movement problems usually first affect the legs, but as the condition worsens,  the arms and eventually the face become involved. In some people with ADLD, the  symptoms worsen during episodes of fever, infection, or exposure to heat. Due to  difficulty walking and an unsteady gait, many affected individuals need a cane,  walker, or wheelchair for assistance. html:p Intelligence is usually unaffected; however, people who have had ADLD for a long  time may have a decline in  function (dementia). ADLD worsens  slowly, and affected individuals usually survive 10 to 20 years after the onset  of symptoms.

In people with  autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia, the damage primarily  causes progressive weakness and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs,  and hands. Muscle weakness may be especially apparent during exercise (exercise  intolerance) and can lead to an unusual walking style (gait), frequent falls,  and in the hands and feet. In some affected  individuals, axonal neuropathy also causes decreased sensitivity to touch, heat,  or cold, particularly in the lower arms or legs. html:p Another feature of this condition is neuromyotonia (also known as Isaac  syndrome). Neuromyotonia results from overactivation (hyperexcitability) of  peripheral nerves, which leads to delayed relaxation of muscles after voluntary  tensing (contraction), muscle cramps, and involuntary rippling movement of the  muscles (myokymia).

Description1: html  html:p Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ARCA1) is a condition  characterized by progressive problems with movement due to a loss (atrophy) of  nerve cells in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (the cerebellum).  Signs and symptoms of the disorder first appear in early to mid-adulthood.  People with this condition initially experience impaired  (),  problems, or both. They may also have  difficulty with movements that involve judging distance or scale (dysmetria).  Other features of ARCA1 include abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) and problems  following the movements of objects with the eyes. The movement problems are  slowly progressive, often resulting in the need for a cane, walker, or  wheelchair.

Description1: html  html:p Autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is an inherited condition that  mainly affects the function of red blood cells. Specifically, it alters a  molecule within these cells called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to  cells and tissues throughout the body. In people with autosomal recessive  congenital methemoglobinemia, some of the normal hemoglobin is replaced by an  abnormal form called methemoglobin, which is unable to deliver oxygen to the  body's tissues. As a result, tissues in the body become oxygen deprived, leading  to a bluish appearance of the skin, lips, and nails (cyanosis). html:p There are two forms of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia: types I  and II. People with type I have cyanosis from birth and may experience weakness  or shortness of breath related to the shortage of oxygen in their tissues.  People with type II have cyanosis as well as severe neurological problems. After  a few months of apparently normal development, children with type II develop  severe, uncontrolled  , and ; also, the size of  their head remains small and does not grow in proportion with their body  (microcephaly). People with type II have severe  disability; they  can recognize faces and usually babble but speak no words. They can sit  unassisted and grip objects but have impaired motor skills that leave them  unable to walk. In type II, . Abnormal facial muscle  movements can interfere with swallowing, which can lead to feeding difficulties  And . html:p People with autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type I have a  normal life expectancy, but people with type II often do not survive past early  adulthood.

frequency1: AR-HIES is a rare disorder whose prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html  html:p Autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome (AR-HIES) is a disorder of the immune  system. A hallmark feature of the condition is recurrent infections that are  severe and can be life-threatening. Skin infections can be caused by bacteria,  viruses, or fungi. These infections cause rashes, blisters, accumulations of pus  (abscesses), open sores, and scaling. People with AR-HIES also tend to have  frequent bouts of pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections. html:p Other immune system-related problems in people with AR-HIES include an  inflammatory skin disorder called eczema, food or environmental allergies, and  asthma. In some affected individuals, the immune system malfunctions and attacks  the body's own tissues and organs, causing autoimmune disease. For example,  autoimmunity can lead to abnormal destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic  anemia) in people with AR-HIES. html:p AR-HIES is characterized by abnormally high levels of an immune system protein  called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood; the levels are more than 10 times  higher than normal. IgE normally triggers an immune response against foreign  invaders in the body, particularly parasitic worms, and plays a role in  allergies. It is unclear why people with AR-HIES have such high levels of this  protein. People with AR-HIES also have highly elevated numbers of certain white  blood cells called eosinophils (hypereosinophilia). Eosinophils aid in the  immune response and are involved in allergic reactions. html:p Some people with AR-HIES have neurological problems, such as paralysis that  affects the face or one side of the body (hemiplegia). Blockage of blood flow in  the brain or abnormal bleeding in the brain, both of which can lead to stroke,  can also occur in AR-HIES. html:p People with AR-HIES have a greater-than-average risk of developing cancer,  particularly cancers of the blood or skin.

Description1: html  html:p Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis is a condition that affects hair growth.  People with this condition have sparse hair (hypotrichosis) on the scalp  beginning in infancy. This hair is usually coarse, dry, and tightly curled  (often described as woolly hair). Scalp hair may also be lighter in color than  expected and is fragile and easily broken. Affected individuals often cannot  grow hair longer than a few inches. The eyebrows, eyelashes, and other body hair  may be sparse as well. Over time, the hair problems can remain stable or  progress to complete scalp hair loss (alopecia) and a decrease in body hair. html:p Rarely, people with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis have skin problems  affecting areas with sparse hair, such as redness (erythema), itchiness  (pruritus), or missing patches of skin (erosions) on the scalp. In areas of poor  hair growth, they may also develop bumps called hyperkeratotic follicular  papules that develop around hair follicles, which are specialized structures in  the skin where hair growth occurs.

People with ARSACS  typically have , difficulty  , muscle wasting (amyotrophy), involuntary eye  movements (nystagmus), and  difficulties (). Other problems  may include deformities of the fingers and feet, reduced sensation and weakness  in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), yellow streaks of fatty tissue in  the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (hypermyelination of the  retina), and less commonly, leaks in one of the valves that control blood flow  through the heart (mitral valve prolapse). An unsteady gait is the first  symptom of ARSACS. It usually appears between the age of 12 months and 18  months, as toddlers are  to walk. The signs and symptoms worsen over  the years, with increased  and ataxia of the arms and legs.

Description1: html  html:p Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is primarily an eye disorder, although it can also  affect other parts of the body. This condition is characterized by abnormalities  of the front part of the eye, an area known as the anterior segment. For  example, the colored part of the eye (the iris), may be thin or poorly  developed. The iris normally has a single central hole, called the pupil,  through which light enters the eye. People with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome often  have a pupil that is off-center (corectopia) or extra holes in the iris that can  look like multiple pupils (polycoria). This condition can also cause  abnormalities of the cornea, which is the clear front covering of the eye. html:p About half of affected individuals develop glaucoma, a serious condition that  increases pressure inside the eye. When glaucoma occurs with Axenfeld-Rieger  syndrome, it most often develops in late childhood or adolescence, although it  can occur as early as infancy. Glaucoma can cause vision loss or blindness. html:p The signs and symptoms of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome can also affect other parts  of the body.

Other sutures of the skull may be fused as well. These changes result  in an abnormally shaped head, a prominent forehead, and bulging eyes with  shallow eye sockets (ocular proptosis). Other distinctive facial features can  include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a small mouth, and a saddle-shaped  or underdeveloped nose. html:p Bone abnormalities in the hands include missing fingers (oligodactyly) and  malformed or absent thumbs. Partial or complete absence of bones in the forearm  is also common. Together, these hand and arm abnormalities are called radial ray  malformations. html:p People with Baller-Gerold syndrome may have a variety of additional signs and  symptoms including , , and  malformed or missing kneecaps (patellae). A skin rash often appears on the arms  and legs a few months after birth.

These chronic skin  problems are collectively known as poikiloderma. html:p The varied signs and symptoms of Baller-Gerold syndrome overlap with features of  other disorders, namely Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and RAPADILINO syndrome.  These syndromes are also characterized by radial ray defects, skeletal  abnormalities, and . All of these conditions can be caused by  mutations in the same gene. Based on these similarities, researchers are  investigating whether Baller-Gerold syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, and  RAPADILINO syndrome are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with  overlapping signs and symptoms.

Description1: html  html:p Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. The  signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among  members of the same family. html:p Vision loss is one of the major features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Loss of  vision occurs as the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye (the retina)  gradually deteriorates. Problems with night vision become apparent by  mid-childhood, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral)  vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision.  Most people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome also develop blurred central vision  (poor visual acuity) and become legally blind by adolescence or early adulthood. html:p Obesity is another characteristic feature of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Abnormal  weight gain typically begins in early childhood and continues to be an issue  throughout life. Complications of obesity can include type 2 diabetes, high  blood pressure (hypertension), and abnormally high cholesterol levels  (hypercholesterolemia). html:p Other major signs and symptoms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome include the presence of  extra fingers or toes (polydactyly),  disability or  problems, and . Most affected males produce  reduced amounts of sex hormones (hypogonadism), and they are usually unable to  father biological children (infertile). Many people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome  also have kidney abnormalities, which can be serious or life-threatening. html:p Additional features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome can include impaired ,  such as  problems such as emotional immaturity and inappropriate outbursts, and  clumsiness or poor coordination. Distinctive facial features, dental  abnormalities, unusually short or fused fingers or toes, and a partial or  complete loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) have also been reported in some  people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Additionally, this condition can affect the  heart, liver, and digestive system.

Description1: html  html:p Bare lymphocyte syndrome type I (BLS I) is an inherited disorder of the immune  system (primary immunodeficiency). Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which  the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign  invaders such as bacteria or viruses. Starting in childhood, most people with  BLS I develop recurrent bacterial infections in the lungs and airways  (respiratory tract). These recurrent infections can lead to a condition called  bronchiectasis, which damages the passages leading from the windpipe to the  lungs (bronchi) and can cause breathing problems. html:p Many people with BLS I also have open sores (ulcers) on their skin, usually on  the face, arms, and legs. These ulcers typically develop in adolescence or young  adulthood. Some people with BLS I have no symptoms of the condition. html:p People with BLS I have a shortage of specialized immune proteins called major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins on cells, including  infection-fighting white blood cells (lymphocytes), which is where the condition  got its name.

Description1: html  html:p Bare lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS II) is an inherited disorder of the immune  system categorized as a form of combined immunodeficiency (CID). People with  BLS II lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or  life-threatening. These infections are often caused by"opportunistic"  organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune  system. html:p BLS II is typically diagnosed in the first year of life. Most affected infants  have persistent infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary  tracts. Because of the infections, affected infants have difficulty absorbing  nutrients (malabsorption), and they grow more slowly than their peers.  Eventually, the persistent infections lead to organ failure. Without treatment,  individuals with BLS II usually do not survive past early childhood. html:p In people with BLS II, infection-fighting white blood cells (lymphocytes) are  missing specialized proteins on their surface called major histocompatibility  complex (MHC) class II proteins, which is where the condition got its name.  Because BLS II is the most common and best studied form of a group of related  conditions, it is often referred to as simply bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS).

Description1: html:p Barth syndrome is a rare condition characterized by an enlarged and weakened  heart (dilated cardiomyopathy), weakness in muscles used for movement (skeletal  myopathy), recurrent infections due to small numbers of white blood cells  (neutropenia), and . Barth syndrome occurs almost exclusively in  males. html:p In males with Barth syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy is often present at birth  or develops within the first months of life. Over time, the heart muscle becomes  increasingly weakened and is less able to pump blood. Individuals with Barth  syndrome may have elastic fibers in place of muscle fibers in some areas of the  heart muscle, which contributes to the cardiomyopathy. This condition is called  endocardial fibroelastosis; it results in thickening of the muscle and impairs  its ability to pump blood. In people with Barth syndrome, the heart problems can  lead to heart failure. In rare cases, the cardiomyopathy gets better over time  and affected individuals eventually have no symptoms of heart disease. html:p In Barth syndrome, skeletal myopathy, particularly of the muscles closest to the  center of the body (proximal muscles), is usually noticeable from birth and  causes  (). The muscle weakness often causes delay of  motor skills such as crawling and walking. Additionally, affected individuals  tend to experience extreme tiredness (fatigue) during strenuous physical  activity. html:p Most males with Barth syndrome have neutropenia. The levels of white blood cells  can be consistently low (persistent), can vary from normal to low  (intermittent), or can cycle between regular episodes of normal and low  (cyclical). Neutropenia makes it more difficult for the body to fight off  foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses, so affected individuals have an  increased risk of recurrent infections. html:p Newborns with Barth syndrome are often , and their  . Some boys with this condition experience a  in puberty and are of average height as adults, but many men with  Barth syndrome continue to have  in adulthood. html:p Males with Barth syndrome often have distinctive facial features including  prominent cheeks. Affected individuals typically have normal intelligence but  often have difficulty performing tasks involving math or visual-spatial skills  such as puzzles. html:p Males with Barth syndrome have increased levels of a substance called  3-methylglutaconic acid in their blood and urine. The amount of the acid does  not appear to influence the signs and symptoms of the condition. Barth syndrome  is one of a group of metabolic disorders that can be diagnosed by the presence  of increased levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in urine (3-methylglutaconic  aciduria). html:p Even though most features of Barth syndrome are present at birth or in infancy,  affected individuals may not experience health problems until later in life. The  age at which individuals with Barth syndrome display symptoms or are diagnosed  varies greatly. The severity of signs and symptoms among affected individuals is  also highly variable. html:p Males with Barth syndrome have a reduced life expectancy. Many affected children  die of heart failure or infection in infancy or early childhood, but those who  live into adulthood can survive into their late forties.

Description1: html:p Bartter syndrome is a group of very similar kidney disorders that cause an  imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and related molecules in the body. html:p In some cases, Bartter syndrome becomes apparent before birth. The disorder can  cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the  fetus (amniotic fluid). Polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth. html:p Beginning in infancy, affected individuals often fail to grow and gain weight at  the expected rate (failure to thrive). They lose excess amounts of salt (sodium  chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and  increased urine production (polyuria). In addition, large amounts of calcium are  lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones  (osteopenia). Some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are  concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue  (nephrocalcinosis). Bartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of  potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness,  cramping, and fatigue. Rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by  abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness). html:p Two major forms of Bartter syndrome are distinguished by their age of onset and  severity. One form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often  life-threatening. The other form, often called the classical form, begins in  early childhood and tends to be less severe. Once the genetic causes of Bartter  syndrome were identified, researchers also split the disorder into different  types based on the genes involved. Types I, II, and IV have the features of  antenatal Bartter syndrome. Because type IV is also associated with hearing  loss, it is sometimes called antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural  deafness. Type III usually has the features of classical Bartter syndrome.

Description1: html:p Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body.  It is classified as an , which means that affected infants  are considerably  and tend to be  their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults  with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other  may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This  unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less  apparent over time. html:p The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected  individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the  wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to  protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft  out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common.  Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue  (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking.  Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs  (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar  (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. html:p Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing  several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of  kidney cancer called Wilms tumor and a form of liver cancer called  hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this  condition and almost always appear in childhood. html:p Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious  medical problems associated with the condition.

The ulcers look like common canker  sores, and they typically heal within one to two weeks. About 75 percent of all  people with Behçet disease develop similar ulcers on the genitals. These ulcers  occur most frequently on the scrotum in men and on the labia in women. html:p Behçet disease can also cause painful bumps and sores on the skin. Most  affected individuals develop pus-filled bumps that resemble acne. These bumps  can occur anywhere on the body. Some affected people also have red, tender  nodules called erythema nodosum. These nodules usually develop on the legs but  can also occur on the arms, face, and neck. html:p An inflammation of the eye called uveitis is found in more than half of people  with Behçet disease. Eye problems are more common in younger people with the  disease and affect men more often than women. Uveitis can result in blurry  vision and an extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia). Rarely, inflammation  can also cause eye pain and redness. If untreated, the eye problems associated  with Behçet disease can lead to blindness. html:p Joint involvement is also common in Behçet disease. Often this affects one joint  at a time, with each affected joint becoming swollen and painful and then  getting better. html:p Less commonly, Behçet disease can affect the brain and spinal cord (central  nervous system), gastrointestinal tract, large blood vessels, heart, lungs, and  kidneys. Central nervous system abnormalities can lead to headaches, confusion,  personality changes, memory loss, impaired , and problems with balance and  movement. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to a hole in the  wall of the intestine (intestinal perforation), which can cause serious  infection and may be life-threatening. html:p The signs and symptoms of Behçet disease usually begin in a person's twenties or  thirties, although they can appear at any age. Some affected people have  relatively mild symptoms that are limited to sores in the mouth and on the  genitals. Others have more severe symptoms affecting various parts of the body,  including the eyes and the vital organs. The features of Behçet disease  typically come and go over a period of months or years. In most affected  individuals, the health problems associated with this disorder improve with age.

Description1: html:p Benign chronic pemphigus, often called Hailey-Hailey disease, is a rare skin  condition that usually appears in early adulthood. The disorder is characterized  by red, raw, and blistered areas of skin that occur most often in skin folds,  such as the groin, armpits, neck, and under the breasts. These inflamed areas  can become crusty or scaly and may itch and burn. The skin problems tend to  worsen with exposure to moisture (such as sweat), friction, and hot weather. html:p The severity of benign chronic pemphigus varies from relatively mild episodes of  skin irritation to widespread, persistent areas of raw and blistered skin that  interfere with daily activities. Affected skin may become infected with bacteria  or fungi, leading to pain and odor. Although the condition is described as  "benign"(noncancerous), in rare cases the skin lesions may develop into a form  of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. html:p Many affected individuals also have white lines running the length of their  fingernails. These lines do not cause any problems, but they can be useful for  diagnosing benign chronic pemphigus.

frequency1: BRIC is a rare disorder. Although the prevalence is unknown, this condition is less common than the related disorder PFIC, which affects approximately 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 people worldwide.
Description1: html:p Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is characterized by episodes of  liver dysfunction called cholestasis. During these episodes, the liver cells  have a reduced ability to release a digestive fluid called bile. Because the  problems with bile release occur within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition  is described as intrahepatic cholestasis. Episodes of cholestasis can last from  weeks to months, and the time between episodes, during which there are usually  no symptoms, can vary from weeks to years. html:p The first episode of cholestasis usually occurs in an affected person's teens or  twenties. An attack typically begins with severe itchiness (pruritus), followed  by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later.  Other general signs and symptoms that occur during these episodes include a  vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), irritability, nausea, vomiting, and a  lack of appetite. A common feature of BRIC is the reduced absorption of fat in  the body, which leads to excess fat in the feces (steatorrhea). Because of a  lack of fat absorption and loss of appetite, affected individuals often lose  weight during episodes of cholestasis. html:p BRIC is divided into two types, BRIC1 and BRIC2, based on the genetic cause of  the condition. The signs and symptoms are the same in both types. html:p This condition is called benign because it does not cause lasting damage to the  liver. However, episodes of liver dysfunction occasionally develop into a more  severe, permanent form of liver disease known as progressive familial  intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). BRIC and PFIC are sometimes considered to be  part of a spectrum of intrahepatic cholestasis disorders of varying severity.

Description1: html:p Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a disorder that  damages the nervous system and is progressive, which means that it gradually  gets worse. Affected individuals develop a buildup of iron in the brain that can  be seen with medical imaging. For this reason, BPAN is classified as a type of  disorder called neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), although  the iron accumulation may not occur until late in the disease. html:p Many people with BPAN have recurrent  () beginning in infancy or  early childhood.

Other seizure types that can occur in  this disorder include short lapses in awareness that can have the appearance of  staring spells or daydreaming (absence , also called petit mal  ), sudden episodes of  (atonic ), involuntary  muscle twitches (myoclonic ), or more pronounced movements called  epileptic spasms. Some individuals have seizure patterns that resemble those in  epileptic syndromes, such as West syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. html:p Children with BPAN also have  including significant problems with vocabulary and producing  (expressive  ), and . Ataxia can affect the  ability to walk and perform fine motor skills such as using utensils. Affected  individuals can have  changes that are often compared to features of a  disorder called Rett syndrome. These features include repeated hand wringing or  clasping (stereotypic hand movements); teeth grinding (bruxism); sleep  disturbances; and problems with  and  interaction  characteristic of . html:p In late adolescence or early adulthood, individuals with BPAN may begin to  experience a gradual loss of  functioning (cognitive decline) that  can lead to a severe loss of thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia).  Worsening problems with movement also occur, including  and  parkinsonism. Dystonia is a condition characterized by involuntary, sustained  . In BPAN, the  often starts in the arms.  Parkinsonism can include unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), rigidity,  s, an inability to hold the body upright and balanced (postural  instability), and a shuffling walk that can cause recurrent falls. html:p The lifespan of people with BPAN varies. With proper management of their signs  and symptoms, affected individuals can live into middle age. Death may result  from complications of dementia or movement problems, such as injuries from falls  or swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) that can lead to a bacterial lung  infection called aspiration pneumonia.

Many people with  thalassemia major have such severe symptoms that they need frequent blood  transfusions to replenish their red blood cell supply. Over time, an influx of  iron-containing hemoglobin from chronic blood transfusions can lead to a buildup  of iron in the body, resulting in liver, heart, and hormone problems. html:p Thalassemia intermedia is milder than thalassemia major.

Description1: html:p Beta-ureidopropionase deficiency is a disorder that causes excessive amounts of  molecules called N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid and  N-carbamyl-beta-alanine to be released in the urine. Neurological problems  ranging from mild to severe also occur in some affected individuals. html:p People with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency can have  (), ,  difficulties,  , and autistic behaviors that affect  and  interaction. Some people with this condition have an abnormally small head size  (microcephaly); they may also have brain abnormalities that can be seen with  medical imaging. Deterioration of the optic nerve, which carries visual  information from the eyes to the brain, can lead to vision loss in this  condition. html:p In some people with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency, the disease causes no  neurological problems and can only be diagnosed by laboratory testing.

Researchers suggest that Bietti crystalline</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">dystrophy may be underdiagnosed because its symptoms are similar to those of</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">other eye disorders that progressively damage the retina.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Bietti crystalline dystrophy is a disorder in which numerous small, yellow or</span>  white crystal-like deposits of fatty (lipid) compounds accumulate in the  light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). The deposits  damage the retina, resulting in progressive vision loss. html:p People with Bietti crystalline dystrophy typically begin noticing vision  problems in their teens or twenties. They experience a loss of sharp vision  (reduction in visual acuity) and difficulty seeing in dim light (night  blindness). They usually lose areas of vision (visual field loss), most often  side (peripheral) vision. Color vision may also be impaired. html:p The vision problems may worsen at different rates in each eye, and the severity  and progression of symptoms varies widely among affected individuals, even  within the same family. However, most people with this condition become legally  blind by their forties or fifties. Most affected individuals retain some degree  of vision, usually in the center of the visual field, although it is typically  blurry and cannot be corrected by glasses or contact lenses. Vision impairment  that cannot be improved with corrective lenses is called low vision.

frequency1: Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. Approximately 48 cases have been reported in the medical literature; most of these are individuals from Arab populations.
Description1: html:p Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is a disorder that affects the  nervous system, including a group of structures in the brain called the basal  ganglia, which help control movement. As its name suggests, the condition may  improve if the vitamins biotin and thiamine are given as treatment. Without  early and lifelong vitamin treatment, people with biotin-thiamine-responsive  basal ganglia disease experience a variety of neurological problems that  gradually get worse. The occurrence of specific neurological problems and their  severity vary even among affected individuals within the same family. html:p The signs and symptoms of biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease  usually begin between the ages of 3 and 10, but the disorder can appear at any  age. Many of the neurological problems that can occur in  biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease affect movement, and can  include involuntary, muscle rigidity,  muscle weakness on one or both sides of the body (hemiparesis or quadriparesis),  , and exaggerated reflexes  (hyperreflexia). Movement problems can also affect the face, and may include the  inability to move facial muscles due to facial nerve paralysis (supranuclear  facial palsy), paralysis of the eye muscles (external ophthalmoplegia),  difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia), and slurred . Affected  individuals may also experience confusion, loss of previously learned skills,  disability, and . Severe cases may result in coma and  become life-threatening. html:p Typically, the neurological symptoms occur as increasingly severe episodes,  which may be triggered by fever, injury, or other stresses on the body. Less  commonly, the signs and symptoms persist at the same level or slowly increase in  severity over time rather than occurring as episodes that come and go. In these  individuals, the neurological problems are usually limited to, seizure  disorders, and

Description1: html:p Björnstad syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal hair and hearing  problems. Affected individuals have a condition known as pili torti, which  means"twisted hair,"so named because the strands appear twisted when viewed  under a microscope. The hair is brittle and breaks easily, leading to short hair  that grows slowly. In Björnstad syndrome, pili torti usually affects only the  hair on the head; eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair on other parts of the body are  normal. The proportion of hairs affected and the severity of brittleness and  breakage can vary. This hair abnormality commonly begins before the age of 2. It  may become milder with age, particularly after puberty. html:p People with Björnstad syndrome also have hearing problems that become evident  in early childhood. The hearing loss, which is caused by changes in the inner  ear (sensorineural deafness), can range from mild to severe. Mildly affected  individuals may be unable to hear sounds at certain frequencies, while severely  affected individuals may not be able to hear at all.

Signs and symptoms begin in childhood, usually before age 4. html:p A form of skin inflammation called granulomatous dermatitis is typically the  earliest sign of Blau syndrome. This skin condition causes a persistent rash  that can be scaly or involve hard lumps (nodules) that can be felt under the  skin. The rash is usually found on the torso, arms, and legs. html:p Arthritis is another common feature of Blau syndrome. In affected individuals,    . This inflammation, known as synovitis, is associated with    . As the condition worsens, it can involve  and r. html:p Most people with Blau syndrome also develop uveitis, which is swelling and  inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (the uvea). The uvea includes the  colored portion of the eye (the iris) and related tissues that underlie the  white part of the eye (the sclera). Uveitis can cause eye irritation and pain,  increased sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), and blurred vision. Other  structures in the eye can also become inflamed, including the outermost  protective layer of the eye (the conjunctiva), the tear glands, the specialized  light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina), and the  nerve that carries information from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve).  Inflammation of any of these structures can lead to severe vision impairment or  blindness. html:p Some individuals with Blau syndrome develop kidney disease (nephritis) due to  inflammation. They may also have deposits of calcium in the kidneys  (nephrocalcinosis) and often develop chronic kidney failure. Inflammation of  blood vessels (vasculitis) can cause scarring and tissue death in the vessels  and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs. html:p Less commonly, Blau syndrome can affect other parts of the body, including the  liver, spleen, salivary gland, brain, blood vessels, lungs, and heart.  Inflammation involving these organs and tissues can impair their function and  cause life-threatening complications. Rarely, affected individuals have episodes  of fever or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the  heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).

Description1: html:p Blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome is a disorder that is present at birth. It  mainly affects the eyelids (blepharo-), upper lip (-cheilo-), and teeth  (-dontic). html:p People with BCD syndrome have lower eyelids that turn out so that the inner  surface is exposed (ectropion). The outside of the lower lid may sag away from  the eye (euryblepharon), and the eyelids may not be able to close completely  (lagophthalmia). There can be extra eyelashes (distichiasis) on the upper  eyelids, ranging from a few extra eyelashes to a full extra set. These eyelashes  do not grow along the edge of the eyelid with the normal lashes, but out of its  inner lining. When the abnormal eyelashes touch the eyeball, they can cause  damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Affected individuals may also  have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a flat face, and a high forehead. html:p Other features of BCD syndrome usually include openings on both sides of the  upper lip (bilateral cleft lip) and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft  palate). Affected individuals may have fewer teeth than normal (oligodontia) and  their teeth are often smaller than usual and cone-shaped. The dental  abnormalities affect both primary teeth (sometimes called"baby teeth") and  secondary (permanent) teeth. Other frequent features include sparse, fine hair  and abnormal nails. html:p Occasionally people with BCD syndrome have additional features, including an  obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus); malformation or absence of  the butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck called the thyroid, resulting in  lack of thyroid gland function; or fused fingers or toes (syndactyly). Very  rarely, affected individuals have incompletely formed arms or legs (limb  reduction defects) or a spinal cord abnormality known as spina bifida.

Because of these eyelid abnormalities,  the eyelids cannot open fully, and vision may be limited. html:p Other structures in the eyes and face may be mildly affected by BPES. Affected  individuals are at an increased risk of developing vision problems such as  nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) beginning in childhood.  They may also have eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus) or  "lazy eye"(amblyopia) affecting one or both eyes. People with BPES may also  have distinctive facial features including a broad nasal bridge, low-set ears,  or a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum). html:p There are two types of BPES, which are distinguished by their signs and  symptoms. Both types I and II include the eyelid malformations and other facial  features. Type I is also associated with an early loss of ovarian function  (primary ovarian insufficiency) in women, which causes their menstrual periods  to become less frequent and eventually stop before age 40. Primary ovarian  insufficiency can lead to difficulty conceiving a child (subfertility) or a  complete inability to conceive (infertility).

frequency1: Bloom syndrome is a rare disorder. Only a few hundred affected individuals have been described in the medical literature, about one-third of whom are of Central and Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish background.
Description1: html:p Bloom syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by , a skin  rash that develops after exposure to the sun, and a greatly increased risk of  cancer. html:p People with Bloom syndrome are usually smaller than 97 percent of the population  in both height and weight from birth, and they rarely exceed 5 feet tall in  adulthood. html:p Affected individuals have skin that is sensitive to sun exposure, and they  usually develop a butterfly-shaped patch of reddened skin across the nose and  cheeks. A skin rash can also appear on other areas that are typically exposed to  the sun, such as the back of the hands and the forearms. Small clusters of  enlarged blood vessels (telangiectases) often appear in the rash; telangiectases  can also occur in the eyes. Other skin features include patches of skin that  are lighter or darker than the surrounding areas (hypopigmentation or  hyperpigmentation respectively). These patches appear on areas of the skin that  are not exposed to the sun, and their development is not related to the rashes. html:p People with Bloom syndrome have an increased risk of cancer. They can develop  any type of cancer, but the cancers arise earlier in life than they do in the  general population, and affected individuals often develop more than one type of  cancer. html:p Individuals with Bloom syndrome have a high-pitched voice and distinctive facial  features including a long, narrow face; a small lower jaw; and prominent nose  and ears. Other features can include  disabilities, an increased risk of  diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mild immune system  abnormalities leading to recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract,  ears, and lungs during infancy. Men with Bloom syndrome usually do not produce  sperm and as a result are unable to father children (infertile). Women with the  disorder generally have reduced fertility and experience menopause at an earlier  age than usual.

Description1: html:p Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) is a rare condition characterized  by abnormalities of the nose and eyes and problems with puberty. html:p The key feature of BAMS is arhinia, which is the absence of an external nose.  While most people with BAMS are born without a nose, some affected individuals  have a severely underdeveloped (hypoplastic) nose. Affected individuals may also  be missing the brain structure involved in the sense of smell (olfactory bulb).  Because of these abnormalities, people with BAMS have an impaired ability to  smell and, consequently, to taste. html:p In most people with BAMS, the eyeballs are abnormally small (microphthalmia) or  absent (anophthalmia), which causes severe vision impairment or blindness.

frequency1: Bradyopsia appears to be rare. Only a few affected individuals worldwide have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Bradyopsia is a rare condition that affects vision. The term"bradyopsia"is  from the Greek words for slow vision. In affected individuals, the eyes adapt  more slowly than usual to changing light conditions. For example, people with  this condition are blinded for several seconds when going from a dark  environment into a bright one, such as when walking out of a darkened movie  theater into daylight. Their eyes also have trouble adapting from bright light  to dark conditions, such as when driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day. html:p Some people with bradyopsia also have difficulty seeing some moving objects,  particularly small objects moving against a bright background. As a result, they  often have trouble watching or participating in sports with a ball, such as  soccer or tennis. People with bradyopsia can have reduced sharpness (acuity) of  vision, although acuity may depend on the conditions under which vision is  tested. Visual acuity may appear to be severely affected if it is tested under  bright lights, but it can be near normal if tested in a dim environment. The  ability to see colors and distinguish between them is normal. html:p The vision problems associated with bradyopsia become apparent in early  childhood. They are usually stable, which means they do not worsen over time.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/brain-lung-thyroid-syndrome
frequency1: Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome is a group of conditions that affect the brain,  lungs, and thyroid gland (a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck).  Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome historically included problems with all three  organs, although the designation now encompasses a combination of brain, lung,  and thyroid problems. About 50 percent of affected individuals have problems  with all three organs, about 30 percent have brain and thyroid problems, and  about 10 percent have brain and lung problems. The brain alone is affected in 10  to 20 percent of people with the condition. Such cases are sometimes called  isolated benign hereditary chorea. html:p Nearly everyone with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome has brain-related movement  abnormalities. Benign hereditary chorea is the most common feature of the  syndrome. This feature is associated with involuntary jerking movements (chorea)  of the face, torso, and limbs; writhing movements (athetosis) of the limbs; and  other movement problems. Individuals with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome can have  other abnormalities, such as , muscle  twitches (myoclonus), and involuntary muscle contractions that result in  twisting and . The movement problems typically  begin around age 1, although they can begin in early infancy or later in life,  and are often preceded by  (). They can  . The movement problems usually remain stable and can  improve over time. Some affected individuals also have  difficulties or  disability. html:p Thyroid problems are the next most common feature of brain-lung-thyroid  syndrome. The thyroid gland makes hormones that help regulate a wide variety of  critical body functions, including growth, brain development, and the rate of  chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Many affected individuals have  reduced thyroid function from birth (congenital hypothyroidism), resulting in  lower-than-normal levels of thyroid hormones. Others have a milder condition  called compensated or subclinical hypothyroidism, in which thyroid hormone  levels are within the normal range, even though the thyroid is not functioning  properly. While most people with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome have a normal-sized  thyroid, the gland is reduced in size (hypoplastic) or absent (aplastic) in  some affected individuals. Although a shortage of thyroid hormones can cause  disability and other neurological problems, it is unclear whether  such issues in individuals with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome are due to  hypothyroidism or to the brain abnormalities related to the condition. html:p Lung problems are common in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. Some affected newborns  have respiratory distress syndrome, which causes extreme difficulty breathing  and can be life-threatening. Other affected individuals develop widespread lung  damage (interstitial lung disease) or scarring in the lungs (pulmonary  fibrosis), both of which can also lead to breathing problems. Recurrent lung  infections, which can be life-threatening, also occur in people with  brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. People with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome have a  higher risk of developing lung cancer than do people in the general population.

Other facial characteristics  include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), an increased distance between the  inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus), outside corners of the eyes that point  upward (upslanting palpebral fissures), a broad nose with a flattened tip, and  weakness of the muscles in the lower face. The ears are also commonly affected,  resulting in malformed or prominent ears. Abnormalities of the inner ear or of  the tiny bones in the ears (ossicles) can cause hearing loss in people with this  condition. html:p Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome can affect other structures and tissues as well.  Some affected individuals have kidney abnormalities, such as malformed kidneys  or multiple kidney cysts.

Description1: html:p Branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome is a condition that disrupts the development of  tissues in the neck and causes malformations of the ears and kidneys. The signs  and symptoms of this condition vary widely, even among members of the same  family. Branchiootic (BO) syndrome includes many of the same features as BOR  syndrome, but affected individuals do not have kidney abnormalities. The two  conditions are otherwise so similar that researchers often consider them  together (BOR/BO syndrome or branchiootorenal spectrum disorders). html:p "Branchio-"refers to the second branchial arch, which is a structure in the  developing embryo that gives rise to tissues in the front and side of the neck.  In people with BOR/BO syndrome,  can result in the  Some affected people have abnormal holes or pits called fistulae in the  side of the neck just above the collarbone. Fistulae can form tunnels into the  neck, exiting in the mouth near the tonsil. Branchial cleft cysts and fistulae  can cause health problems if they become infected, so they are often removed  surgically. html:p "Oto-"and"-otic"refer to the ear; most people with BOR/BO syndrome have  hearing loss and other ear abnormalities. The hearing loss can be sensorineural,  meaning it is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear; conductive, meaning it  results from changes in the small bones in the middle ear; or mixed, meaning it  is caused by a combination of inner ear and middle ear abnormalities. Some  affected people have tiny holes in the skin or extra bits of tissue just in  front of the ear. These are called preauricular pits and preauricular tags,  respectively. html:p "Renal"refers to the kidneys; BOR syndrome (but not BO syndrome) causes  abnormalities of kidney structure and function. These abnormalities range from  mild to severe and can affect one or both kidneys. In some cases, end-stage  renal disease (ESRD) develops later in life. This serious condition occurs when  the kidneys become unable to filter fluids and waste products from the body  effectively.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. (Only</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">skin cancer is more common.) About one in eight women in the United States will</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">develop invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Researchers estimate that more</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">than 230,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in U.S. women</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">in 2015.Male breast cancer represents less than 1 percent of all breast cancer</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">diagnoses. Scientists estimate that about 2,300 new cases of breast cancer will</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">be diagnosed in men in 2015.Particular gene mutations associated with breast</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">cancer are more common among certain geographic or ethnic groups, such as people</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">of Ashkenazi (central or eastern European) Jewish heritage and people of</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Norwegian, Icelandic, or Dutch ancestry.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal</span>  and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Although breast cancer is much more  common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women  and men, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk  ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that  produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so  lobular cancer in men is very rare. html:p In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit  no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include  a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of  the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and  skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. However, these changes can occur as  part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not  mean that a person definitely has breast cancer. html:p In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to  other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often  appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and  then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. html:p A small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. These cancers are  described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations.  Hereditary breast cancers tend to develop earlier in life than noninherited  (sporadic) cases, and new (primary) tumors are more likely to develop in both  breasts.

Description1: html:p Brody myopathy is a condition that affects the skeletal muscles, which are the  muscles used for movement. Affected individuals experience muscle cramping and  stiffening after exercise or other strenuous activity, especially in cold  temperatures. These symptoms typically begin in childhood. They are usually  painless, but in some cases can cause mild discomfort. The muscles usually relax  after a few minutes of rest. Most commonly affected are the muscles of the  arms, legs, and face (particularly the eyelids). html:p In some people with Brody myopathy, exercise leads to the breakdown of muscle  tissue (rhabdomyolysis). The destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein  called myoglobin, which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine  (myoglobinuria). Myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown.

frequency1: Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a condition involving multiple skin tumors that  develop from structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as  sweat glands and hair follicles. People with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome may  develop several types of tumors, including growths called spiradenomas,  trichoepitheliomas, and cylindromas. Spiradenomas develop in sweat glands.  Trichoepitheliomas arise from hair follicles. The origin of cylindromas has been  unclear; while previously thought to derive from sweat glands, they are now  generally believed to begin in hair follicles. The tumors associated with  Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are generally noncancerous (benign), but occasionally  they may become cancerous (malignant). Affected individuals are also at  increased risk of developing tumors in tissues other than skin appendages,  particularly benign or malignant tumors of the salivary glands. html:p People with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome typically begin developing tumors in early  adulthood. The tumors are most often found on the head and neck. They grow  larger and increase in number over time. In severe cases, the tumors may get in  the way of the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth and affect vision, hearing, or other  functions. The tumors can be disfiguring and may contribute to  or  other psychological problems. For reasons that are unclear, females with  Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are often more severely affected than males.

Researchers suspect that testosterone, a sex hormone present at much higher levels in men, may account for this difference.
Description1: html:p Brugada syndrome is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal  rhythm. Specifically, this disorder can lead to irregular heartbeats in the  heart's lower chambers (ventricles), which is an abnormality called ventricular  arrhythmia. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can cause fainting (syncope),  , difficulty breathing, or sudden death. These complications typically  occur when an affected person is resting or asleep. html:p Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although it can develop  any time throughout life. Signs and symptoms related to arrhythmias, including  sudden death, can occur from early infancy to late adulthood. Sudden death  typically occurs around age 40. This condition may explain some cases of sudden  infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of death in babies younger  than 1 year. SIDS is characterized by sudden and unexplained death, usually  during sleep. html:p Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) is a condition characterized  by unexpected cardiac arrest in young adults, usually at night during sleep.  This condition was originally described in Southeast Asian populations, where it  is a major cause of death. Researchers have determined that SUNDS and Brugada  syndrome are the same disorder.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/c3-glomerulopathy
frequency1: C3 glomerulopathy is very rare, affecting 1 to 2 per million people worldwide. It is equally common in men and women.
Description1: html:p C3 glomerulopathy is a group of related conditions that cause the kidneys to  malfunction. The major features of C3 glomerulopathy include high levels of  protein in the urine (proteinuria), blood in the urine (hematuria), reduced  amounts of urine, low levels of protein in the blood, and swelling in many areas  of the body. Affected individuals may have particularly low levels of a protein  called complement component 3 (or C3) in the blood. html:p The kidney problems associated with C3 glomerulopathy tend to worsen over time.  About half of affected individuals develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within  10 years after their diagnosis. ESRD is a life-threatening condition that  prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body  effectively. html:p Researchers have identified two major forms of C3 glomerulopathy: dense deposit  disease and C3 glomerulonephritis. Although the two disorders cause similar  kidney problems, the features of dense deposit disease tend to appear earlier  than those of C3 glomerulonephritis, usually in adolescence. However, the signs  and symptoms of either disease may not begin until adulthood. html:p One of the two forms of C3 glomerulopathy, dense deposit disease, can also be  associated with other conditions unrelated to kidney function. For example,  people with dense deposit disease may have acquired partial lipodystrophy, a  condition characterized by a lack of fatty (adipose) tissue under the skin in  the upper part of the body. Additionally, some people with dense deposit disease  develop a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen in the light-sensitive  tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). These deposits usually appear in  childhood or adolescence and can cause vision problems later in life.

A few hundred cases have been described in the medical</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">literature. Researchers believe this condition is probably underdiagnosed</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">because it usually goes away by itself in early childhood.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Caffey disease, also called infantile cortical hyperostosis, is a bone disorder</span>  that most often occurs in babies. Excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) is  characteristic of Caffey disease. The bone abnormalities mainly affect the  jawbone, shoulder blades (scapulae), collarbones (clavicles), and the shafts  (diaphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs. Affected bones may double or  triple in width, which can be seen by x-ray imaging. In some cases two bones  that are next to each other, such as two ribs or the pairs of long bones in the  forearms (radius and ulna) or lower legs (tibia and fibula) become fused  together. Babies with Caffey disease also have  and of soft  tissues such as muscles, with pain and redness in the affected areas. Affected  infants can also be feverish and irritable. html:p The signs and symptoms of Caffey disease are usually apparent by the time an  infant is 5 months old. In rare cases, skeletal abnormalities can be detected by  ultrasound imaging during the last few weeks of development before birth.  Lethal prenatal cortical hyperostosis, a more severe disorder that appears  earlier in development and is often fatal before or shortly after birth, is  sometimes called lethal prenatal Caffey disease; however, it is generally  considered to be a separate disorder. html:p For unknown reasons, the swelling and pain associated with Caffey disease  typically go away within a few months. Through a normal process called bone  remodeling, which replaces old bone tissue with new bone, the excess bone is  usually reabsorbed by the body and undetectable on x-ray images by the age of 2.  However, if two adjacent bones have fused, they may remain that way, possibly  resulting in complications. For example, fused rib bones can lead to curvature  of the spine (scoliosis) or limit expansion of the chest, resulting in breathing  problems. html:p Most people with Caffey disease have no further problems related to the disorder  after early childhood. Occasionally, another episode of hyperostosis occurs  years later. In addition, some adults who had Caffey disease in infancy have  other abnormalities of the bones and connective tissues, which provide strength  and flexibility to structures throughout the body. Affected adults may have  , stretchy (hyperextensible) skin, or be prone to  protrusion of organs through gaps in muscles (hernias).

frequency1: The prevalence of campomelic dysplasia is uncertain; estimates range from 1 in 40,000 to 200,000 people.
Description1: html:p Campomelic dysplasia is a severe disorder that affects development of the  skeleton, reproductive system, and other parts of the body. This condition is  often life-threatening in the newborn period. html:p The term"campomelic"comes from the Greek words for"bent limb."Affected  individuals are typically born with bowing of the long bones in the legs, and  occasionally, bowing in the arms. Bowing can cause characteristic skin dimples  to form over the curved bone, especially on the lower legs. People with  campomelic dysplasia usually have short legs, dislocated hips, underdeveloped  shoulder blades, 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12, bone abnormalities in the neck,  and inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet). These skeletal abnormalities  begin developing before birth and can often be seen on ultrasound. When affected  individuals have features of this disorder but do not have bowed limbs, they  are said to have acampomelic campomelic dysplasia. html:p Many people with campomelic dysplasia  . Approximately 75 percent  of affected individuals with a typical male chromosome pattern (46,XY) have  or normal female genitalia. Internal reproductive organs may  not correspond with the external genitalia; the internal organs can be male  (testes), female (ovaries), or a combination of the two. For example, an  individual with female external genitalia may have testes or a combination of  testes and ovaries. html:p Affected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a small chin,  prominent eyes, and a flat face. They also have a large head compared to their  body size. A particular group of physical features, called Pierre Robin  sequence, is common in people with campomelic dysplasia. Pierre Robin sequence  includes an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), a tongue that is  placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw  (micrognathia). People with campomelic dysplasia are often born with weakened  cartilage that forms the upper respiratory tract. This abnormality, called  laryngotracheomalacia, partially blocks the airway and causes difficulty  breathing. Laryngotracheomalacia contributes to the poor survival of infants  with campomelic dysplasia. html:p Only a few people with campomelic dysplasia survive past infancy. As these  individuals age, they may develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis)  and other spine abnormalities that compress the spinal cord. People with  campomelic dysplasia may also have  and hearing loss.

frequency1: The prevalence of Camurati-Engelmann disease is unknown. More than 300 cases have been reported worldwide.
Description1: html:p Camurati-Engelmann disease is a skeletal condition that is characterized by  abnormally thick bones (hyperostosis) in the arms, legs, and skull. html:p The thick limb bones can lead to bone pain and muscle weakness in the arms and  legs and cause individuals with Camurati-Engelmann disease to tire quickly. Bone  pain ranges from mild to severe and can increase with stress, activity, or cold  weather. Leg weakness can make it difficult to stand up from a seated position  and some affected individuals develop a waddling or unsteady walk. Additional  limb abnormalities include, knock knees (a  condition in which the lower legs are positioned at an outward angle), and flat  feet (pes planus). Swelling and redness (erythema) of the limbs and an abnormal  curvature of the spine can also occur. html:p Individuals with Camurati-Engelmann disease may have an unusually thick skull,  which can lead to an abnormally large head (macrocephaly) and lower jaw  (mandible), a prominent forehead (frontal bossing), and bulging eyes with  shallow eye sockets (ocular proptosis). These changes to the head and face  become more prominent with age and are most noticeable in affected adults. In  about a quarter of individuals with Camurati-Engelmann disease, the thickened  skull increases pressure on the brain or compresses the spinal cord, which can  cause a variety of neurological problems, including headaches, hearing loss,  vision problems, dizziness (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and facial  paralysis. html:p The degree of hyperostosis varies among individuals with Camurati-Engelmann  disease as does the age at which they experience their first symptoms. html:p Other, rare features of Camurati-Engelmann disease include abnormally long limbs  in proportion to height, a decrease in muscle mass and body fat, delayed  teething (dentition), frequent cavities, delayed puberty, a shortage of red  blood cells (anemia), an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly),  thinning of the skin, and excessively sweaty (hyperhidrotic) hands and feet.

Description1: html:p Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is a  disorder of the vascular system, which is the body's complex network of blood  vessels. The vascular system consists of arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood  from the heart to the body's various organs and tissues; veins, which carry  blood back to the heart; and capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that  connect arteries and veins. html:p CM-AVM is characterized by capillary malformations (CMs), which are composed of  enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin.  These malformations look like multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the  skin. In most affected individuals, capillary malformations occur on the face,  arms, and legs. These spots may be visible from birth or may develop during  childhood. By themselves, capillary malformations usually do not cause any  health problems. html:p In some people with CM-AVM, capillary malformations are the only sign of the  disorder. However, other affected individuals also have more serious vascular  abnormalities known as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous  fistulas (AVFs). AVMs and AVFs are abnormal connections between arteries, veins,  and capillaries that affect blood circulation. Depending on where they occur in  the body, these abnormalities can be associated with complications including  abnormal bleeding, migraine headaches, , and heart failure. In some  cases the complications can be life-threatening. In people with CM-AVM,  complications of AVMs and AVFs tend to appear in infancy or early childhood;  however, some of these vascular abnormalities never cause any symptoms. html:p Some vascular abnormalities seen in CM-AVM are similar to those that occur in a  condition called Parkes Weber syndrome. In addition to vascular abnormalities,  Parkes Weber syndrome usually involves overgrowth of one limb. CM-AVM and some  cases of Parkes Weber syndrome have the same genetic cause.

These potentially life-threatening episodes can cause poor  feeding, vomiting, weight loss, tiredness (lethargy), rapid breathing  (tachypnea), , or coma. html:p During an episode, people with carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency have excess  ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), problems with acid-base balance in the  blood (metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis), low glucose in the blood  (hypoglycemia), and reduced production of a substance called bicarbonate in the  liver. These imbalances lead to the signs and symptoms that occur during the  episodes. html:p People with carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency typically first experience episodes  of the disorder by age 2. These episodes may be triggered by going without food  (fasting) for longer than usual between meals or when energy demands are  increased, such as during illness. Between episodes, children with carbonic  anhydrase VA deficiency are generally healthy, and more than half have no  further episodes after the first one. Some affected children have mildly  , while others develop normally for their  age. html:p The risk of metabolic crisis and acute encephalopathy is thought to decrease  after childhood. Because of the small number of people with carbonic anhydrase  VA deficiency who have come to medical attention, the effects of this disorder  in adults are not well understood.

frequency1: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is a very rare condition whose incidence is unknown. Researchers estimate that 200 to 300 people worldwide have this condition.
Description1: html:p Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body,  particularly the heart (cardio-), facial features (facio-), and the skin and  hair (cutaneous). People with this condition also have  , usually ranging from moderate to severe. html:p s occur in most people with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. The heart  problems most commonly associated with this condition include malformations of  one of the heart valves that impairs blood flow from the heart to the lungs  (pulmonic stenosis), a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart (atrial  septal defect), and a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart  muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). html:p Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is also characterized by distinctive facial  features. These include a high forehead that narrows at the temples, a short  nose, widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), outside corners of the eyes  that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures), droopy eyelids (ptosis),  a small chin, and low-set ears. Overall, the face is broad and long, and the  facial features are sometimes described as"coarse." html:p Skin abnormalities occur in almost everyone with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.  Many affected people have dry, rough skin; dark-colored moles (nevi); wrinkled  palms and soles; and a skin condition called keratosis pilaris, which causes  small bumps to form on the arms, legs, and face. People with  cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome also tend to have thin, dry, curly hair and sparse  or absent eyelashes and eyebrows. html:p Infants with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome typically have  (), feeding difficulties, and a failure to grow and gain weight at the  normal rate (failure to thrive). Additional features of this disorder in  children and adults can include an unusually large head (macrocephaly),  , problems with vision, and . html:p The signs and symptoms of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome overlap significantly  with those of two other genetic conditions, Costello syndrome and Noonan  syndrome. The three conditions are distinguished by their genetic cause and  specific patterns of signs and symptoms; however, it can be difficult to tell  these conditions apart, particularly in infancy. Unlike Costello syndrome, which  significantly increases a person's cancer risk, cancer does not appear to be a  major feature of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.

frequency1: Carney complex is a rare disorder; fewer than 750 affected individuals have been identified.
Description1: html:p Carney complex is a disorder characterized by an increased risk of several types  of tumors. Affected individuals also usually have changes in skin coloring  (pigmentation). Signs and symptoms of this condition commonly begin in the teens  or early adulthood. html:p Individuals with Carney complex are at increased risk of developing noncancerous  (benign) tumors called myxomas in the heart (cardiac myxoma) and other parts of  the body. Cardiac myxomas may be found in any of the four chambers of the heart  and can develop in more than one chamber. These tumors can block the flow of  blood through the heart, causing serious complications or sudden death. Myxomas  may also develop on the skin and in internal organs. Skin myxomas appear as  small bumps on the surface of the skin or as lumps underneath the skin. In  Carney complex, myxomas have a tendency to recur after they are removed. html:p Individuals with Carney complex also develop tumors in hormone-producing  (endocrine) glands, such as the adrenal glands located on top of each kidney.  People with this condition may develop a specific type of adrenal disease called  primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). PPNAD causes the  adrenal glands to produce an excess of the hormone cortisol.  can lead to the development of Cushing syndrome.  This syndrome causes weight gain in the face and upper body,  , fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems. html:p People with Carney complex may also develop tumors of other endocrine tissues,  including the thyroid, testes, and ovaries. A tumor called an adenoma may form  in the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. A pituitary  adenoma usually results in the production of too much growth hormone. Excess  growth hormone leads to acromegaly, a condition characterized by large hands and  feet, arthritis, and"coarse"facial features. html:p Some people with Carney complex develop a rare tumor called psammomatous  melanotic schwannoma. This tumor occurs in specialized cells called Schwann  cells, which wrap around and insulate nerves. This tumor is usually benign, but  in some cases it can become cancerous (malignant). html:p Almost all people with Carney complex have areas of unusual skin pigmentation.  Brown skin spots called lentigines may appear anywhere on the body but tend to  occur around the lips, eyes, or genitalia. In addition, some affected  individuals have at least one blue-black mole called a blue nevus.

Description1: html:p Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency is a condition that  prevents the body from using certain fats for energy, particularly during  periods without food (fasting). There are three main types of CPT II deficiency:  a lethal neonatal form, a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form, and a  myopathic form. html:p The lethal neonatal form of CPT II deficiency becomes apparent soon after birth.  Infants with this form of the disorder develop respiratory failure, ,  liver failure, a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), and an irregular heart  beat (arrhythmia). Affected individuals also have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)  and a low level of ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fats and  used for energy. Together these signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia. In  many cases, the brain and kidneys are also structurally abnormal. Infants with  the lethal neonatal form of CPT II deficiency usually live for a few days to a  few months. html:p The severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form of CPT II deficiency affects the  liver, heart, and muscles. Signs and symptoms usually appear within the first  year of life. This form involves recurring episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia,  , an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia.  Problems related to this form of CPT II deficiency can be triggered by periods  of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. Individuals with the severe  infantile hepatocardiomuscular form of CPT II deficiency are at risk for liver  failure, nervous system damage, coma, and sudden death. html:p The myopathic form is the least severe type of CPT II deficiency. This form is  characterized by recurrent episodes of muscle pain (myalgia) and weakness and is  associated with the breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). The  destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is  processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). Myoglobin  causes the urine to be red or brown. This protein can also damage the kidneys,  in some cases leading to life-threatening kidney failure. Episodes of myalgia  and rhabdomyolysis may be triggered by exercise, stress, exposure to extreme  temperatures, infections, or fasting. The first episode usually occurs during  childhood or adolescence. Most people with the myopathic form of CPT II  deficiency have no signs or symptoms of the disorder between episodes.

Description1: html:p Carpenter syndrome is a condition characterized by the premature fusion of  certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), abnormalities of the fingers and toes,  and other html:p Craniosynostosis prevents the skull from growing normally, frequently giving the  head a pointed appearance (acrocephaly). In severely affected individuals, the  abnormal fusion of the skull bones results in a deformity called a cloverleaf  skull. Craniosynostosis can cause differences between the two sides of the head  and face (craniofacial asymmetry). Early fusion of the skull bones can affect  and lead to  . Premature fusion of the skull bones can cause several  characteristic facial features in people with Carpenter syndrome. Distinctive  facial features may include a flat nasal bridge, outside corners of the eyes  that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures), low-set and abnormally  shaped ears, underdeveloped upper and lower jaws, and abnormal eye shape. Some  affected individuals also have dental abnormalities including small primary  (baby) teeth. Vision problems also frequently occur. html:p Abnormalities of the fingers and toes include fusion of the skin between two or  more fingers or toes (cutaneous syndactyly), unusually short fingers or toes  (brachydactyly), or extra fingers or toes (polydactyly). In Carpenter syndrome,  cutaneous syndactyly is most common between the third (middle) and fourth (ring)  fingers, and polydactyly frequently occurs next to the big or second toe or the  fifth (pinky) finger. html:p People with Carpenter syndrome often have  disability, which can  range from mild to profound. However, some individuals with this condition have  normal intelligence. The cause of  disability is unknown, as the  severity of craniosynostosis does not appear to be related to the severity of  disability. html:p Other features of Carpenter syndrome include obesity that begins in childhood, a  soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia), hearing loss, and  s. Additional skeletal abnormalities such as deformed hips, a  rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), and knees that  are angled inward (genu valgum) frequently occur. Nearly all affected males  have , most frequently undescended testes (cryptorchidism). html:p A few people with Carpenter syndrome have organs or tissues within their chest  and abdomen that are in mirror-image reversed positions. This abnormal placement  may affect several internal organs (situs inversus); just the heart  (dextrocardia), placing the heart on the right side of the body instead of on  the left; or only the major (great) arteries of the heart, altering blood flow. html:p The signs and symptoms of this disorder vary considerably, even within the same  family. The life expectancy for individuals with Carpenter syndrome is shortened  but extremely variable. html:p The signs and symptoms of Carpenter syndrome are similar to another genetic  condition called Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. The overlapping features,  which include craniosynostosis, polydactyly, and heart abnormalities, can cause  these two conditions to be misdiagnosed; genetic testing is often required for  an accurate diagnosis.

Description1: html:p Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a condition  characterized by an  (arrhythmia). As the heart rate  increases in response to physical activity or emotional stress, it can trigger  an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat called ventricular tachycardia.  Episodes of ventricular tachycardia can cause light-headedness, dizziness, and  fainting (syncope). In people with CPVT, these episodes typically begin in  childhood. html:p If CPVT is not recognized and treated, an episode of ventricular tachycardia may  cause the heart to stop beating (cardiac arrest), leading to sudden death.  Researchers suspect that CPVT may be a significant cause of sudden death in  children and young adults without recognized heart abnormalities.

This condition is much more common in infants born to mothers with</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">diabetes when it affects an estimated 1 in 350 newborns.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Caudal regression syndrome is a disorder that impairs the development of the</span>  lower (caudal) half of the body. Affected areas can include the lower back and  limbs, the genitourinary tract, and the gastrointestinal tract. html:p In this disorder, the bones of the lower spine (vertebrae) are frequently  misshapen or missing, and the corresponding sections of the spinal cord are also  irregular or missing. Affected individuals may have incomplete closure of the  vertebrae around the spinal cord, a fluid-filled sac on the back covered by skin  that may or may not contain part of the spinal cord, or tufts of hair at the  base of the spine. People with caudal regression syndrome can also have an  abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The spinal  abnormalities may affect the size and shape of the chest, leading to breathing  problems in some individuals. html:p Individuals with caudal regression syndrome may have small hip bones with a  limited range of motion. The buttocks tend to be flat and dimpled. The bones of  the legs are typically underdeveloped, most frequently the upper leg bones  (femurs). In some individuals, the legs are bent with the knees pointing out to  the side and the feet tucked underneath the hips (sometimes called a frog  leg-like position). Affected individuals may be born with inward- and  upward-turning feet (clubfeet), or the feet may be outward- and upward-turning  (calcaneovalgus). Some people experience decreased sensation in their lower  limbs. html:p Abnormalities in the genitourinary tract in caudal regression syndrome are  extremely varied. Often the kidneys are malformed; defects include a missing  kidney (unilateral renal agenesis), kidneys that are fused together (horseshoe  kidney), or duplication of the tubes that carry urine from each kidney to the  bladder (ureteral duplication). These kidney abnormalities can lead to frequent  urinary tract infections and progressive kidney failure. Additionally, affected  individuals may have protrusion of the bladder through an opening in the  abdominal wall (bladder exstrophy). Damage to the nerves that control bladder  function, a condition called neurogenic bladder, causes affected individuals to  have progressive difficulty controlling the flow of urine.  in males can include the urethra opening on the underside of the penis  (hypospadia) or undescended testes (cryptorchidism). Females may have an  abnormal connection between the rectum and vagina (rectovaginal fistula). In  severe cases, both males and females have a lack of  . html:p People with caudal regression syndrome may have abnormal twisting (malrotation)  of the large intestine, an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus),  soft out-pouchings in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernias), or other  malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Affected individuals are often  constipated and may experience loss of control of bladder and bowel function.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive</span>  to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an  autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system  malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict,  lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system  overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts  of the body. html:p Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods  containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from  inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the  villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine  and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac  disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal  damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to  weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are  common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead  to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as  cancers of the small intestine or esophagus. html:p Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many  other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health  problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood  cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis),  itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the  teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, , delayed puberty, infertility,  or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with  celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, ,  , and recurrent  (). Many people  with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not  have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic  celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is  actually more common than the classic form. html:p Celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are  nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have  one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On  average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after  symptoms begin. html:p Some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the  disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in  their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. They also have  inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy. html:p In a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free  diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is  characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor  absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of  the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.

Description1: html:p Central core disease is a disorder that affects muscles used for movement  (skeletal muscles). This condition causes muscle weakness that ranges from  almost unnoticeable to very severe. html:p Most people with central core disease experience persistent, mild muscle  weakness that does not worsen with time. This weakness affects the muscles near  the center of the body (proximal muscles), particularly muscles in the upper  legs and hips. Muscle weakness causes affected infants to appear"floppy"and    . In severe cases, affected infants experience profoundly  () and serious or life-threatening breathing problems. Central  core disease is also associated with skeletal abnormalities such as abnormal  curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip dislocation, and  . html:p Many people with central core disease also have an increased risk of developing  a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery and other invasive  procedures. This reaction is called malignant hyperthermia. Malignant  hyperthermia occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to  block the sensation of pain, and with a particular type of muscle relaxant. If  given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience  muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever,  increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid  heart rate. The complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening  unless they are treated promptly. html:p Central core disease gets its name from disorganized areas called cores, which  are found in the center of muscle fibers in many affected individuals. These  abnormal regions can only be seen under a microscope. Although the presence of  cores can help doctors diagnose central core disease, it is unclear how they are  related to muscle weakness and the other features of this condition.

People with  centronuclear myopathy may have droopy eyelids (ptosis) and weakness in other  facial muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. People with  this condition may also have foot abnormalities, a high arch in the roof of the  mouth (high-arched palate), and abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine  (scoliosis). Rarely, individuals with centronuclear myopathy have a weakened  heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy), or  disability. html:p A key feature of centronuclear myopathy is the displacement of the nucleus in  muscle cells, which can be viewed under a microscope. Normally the nucleus is  found at the edges of the rod-shaped muscle cells, but in people with  centronuclear myopathy the nucleus is located in the center of these cells. How  the change in location of the nucleus affects muscle cell function is unknown.

Description1: leukoencephalopathy, usually called CADASIL, is an inherited condition that  causes stroke and other impairments. This condition affects blood flow in small  blood vessels, particularly cerebral vessels within the brain. The muscle cells  surrounding these blood vessels (vascular smooth muscle cells) are abnormal and  gradually die. In the brain, the resulting blood vessel damage (arteriopathy)  can cause migraines, often with visual sensations or auras, or recurrent  (). html:p Damaged blood vessels reduce blood flow and can cause areas of tissue death  (infarcts) throughout the body. An infarct in the brain can lead to a stroke. In  individuals with CADASIL, a stroke can occur at any time from childhood to late  adulthood, but typically happens during mid-adulthood. People with CADASIL  often have more than one stroke in their lifetime. Recurrent strokes can damage  the brain over time. Strokes that occur in the subcortical region of the brain,  which is involved in reasoning and memory, can cause progressive loss of  function (dementia) and changes in mood and personality. html:p Many people with CADASIL also develop leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in  a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI). html:p The age at which the signs and symptoms of CADASIL first begin varies greatly  among affected individuals, as does the severity of these features. html:p CADASIL is not associated with the common risk factors for stroke and heart  attack, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, although some affected  individuals might also have these health problems.

As the disease progresses, most people with CARASIL also develop  mood and personality changes, a decline in thinking ability (dementia), memory  loss, and worsening problems with movement. html:p Other characteristic features of CARASIL include premature hair loss (alopecia)  and attacks of low back pain. The hair loss often begins during adolescence and  is limited to the scalp. Back pain, which develops in early to mid-adulthood,  results from the breakdown (degeneration) of the discs that separate the bones  of the spine (vertebrae) from one another. html:p The signs and symptoms of CARASIL worsen slowly with time. Over the course of  several years, affected individuals become less able to control their emotions  and communicate with others. They increasingly require help with personal care  and other activities of daily living; after a few years, they become unable to  care for themselves. Most affected individuals die within a decade after signs  and symptoms first appear, although few people with the disease have survived  for 20 to 30 years.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Cerebral cavernous malformations are collections of small blood vessels</span>  (capillaries) in the brain that are enlarged and irregular in structure. These  capillaries have abnormally thin walls, and they lack other support tissues,  such as elastic fibers, which normally make them stretchy. As a result, the  blood vessels are prone to leakage, which can cause the health problems related  to this condition. Cavernous malformations can occur anywhere in the body, but  usually produce serious signs and symptoms only when they occur in the brain and  spinal cord (which are described as cerebral). html:p Approximately 25 percent of individuals with cerebral cavernous malformations  never experience any related health problems. Other people with this condition  may experience serious signs and symptoms such as headaches, ,  paralysis, hearing or vision loss, and bleeding in the brain (cerebral  hemorrhage). Severe brain hemorrhages can result in death. The location and  number of cerebral cavernous malformations determine the severity of this  disorder. These malformations can change in size and number over time. html:p There are two forms of the condition: familial and sporadic. The familial form  is passed from parent to child, and affected individuals typically have multiple  cerebral cavernous malformations. The sporadic form occurs in people with no  family history of the disorder. These individuals typically have only one  malformation.

frequency1: The prevalence of cerebral folate transport deficiency is unknown. Fewer than 20 affected individuals have been described in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Cerebral folate transport deficiency is a disorder that develops from a shortage  (deficiency) of the B-vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9) in the brain.  Affected children have normal development during infancy, but around age 2 they  begin to  . They   ,  difficulties, and  recurrent  (). Movement problems such as s and difficulty  can be severe, and some affected individuals  need wheelchair assistance. Affected individuals have leukodystrophy, which is a  loss of a type of brain tissue known as white matter. White matter consists of  nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that promotes the rapid  transmission of nerve impulses. Leukodystrophy contributes to the neurological  problems that occur in cerebral folate transport deficiency. Without treatment,  these neurological problems worsen over time.

frequency1: The incidence of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is estimated to be 1 per <span style="background:#FFFF00;">million individuals worldwide. This condition is more common in the Moroccan</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Jewish population with an incidence of 1 in 108 individuals.</span>
Description1: html:p Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a disorder characterized by abnormal storage  of fats (lipids) in many areas of the body. People with this disorder cannot  break down certain lipids effectively, specifically different forms of  cholesterol, so these fats accumulate in the body in the form of fatty yellow  nodules called xanthomas. These xanthomas are most commonly found in the brain  and in connective tissue called tendons that attach muscle to bone, which is  reflected in the condition name (cerebro- meaning brain and -tendinous referring  to tendons). html:p People with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis often develop neurological problems  in early adulthood that are thought to be caused by an abnormal accumulation of  fats and an increasing number of xanthomas in the brain. These neurological  problems include recurrent  (), movement disorders, impaired  (), loss of sensation in the arms and legs (peripheral  neuropathy), decline in  function (dementia), hallucinations, and  . Xanthomas can accumulate in the fatty substance that insulates and  protects nerves (myelin), causing the destruction of myelin and disrupting nerve  signaling in the brain. Degeneration (atrophy) of brain tissue caused by excess  lipid deposits also contributes to the neurological problems. html:p Xanthomas in the tendons begin to form in early adulthood. The most common areas  for xanthomas to develop are tendons in the hands, elbows, knees, neck, and in  the Achilles tendon, which connects the heel of the foot to the calf muscles in  the leg. Tendon xanthomas may cause discomfort and interfere with tendon  flexibility. While many affected people develop tendon xanthomas, these nodules  may not be easily visible underneath the skin. html:p Other features of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis include clouding of the lenses  of the eyes (cataracts) and chronic diarrhea in childhood; a reduced ability to  produce and release a digestive fluid called bile (cholestasis), which can lead  to a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice); and progressively  brittle bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis). People with  cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are also at an increased risk of developing  cardiovascular disease or respiratory failure because of lipid accumulation in  the heart or lungs, respectively. If untreated, the signs and symptoms related  to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis worsen over time; however, this condition  varies greatly among those who are affected.

frequency1: Char syndrome is rare, although its exact incidence is unknown. Only a few families with this condition have been identified worldwide.
Description1: html:p Char syndrome is a condition that affects the development of the face, heart,  and limbs. It is characterized by a combination of three major features: a  distinctive facial appearance, a  called,  and hand abnormalities. html:p Most people with Char syndrome have a characteristic facial appearance that  includes flattened cheek bones and a flat nasal bridge (the area of the nose  between the eyes). The tip of the nose is also flat and broad. The eyes are  wide-set with droopy eyelids (ptosis) and outside corners that point downward  (down-slanting palpebral fissures). Additional facial differences include a  shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum), a  triangular-shaped mouth, and thick, prominent lips. html:p Patent ductus arteriosus is a common  in newborns, and it occurs in  most babies with Char syndrome. Before birth, the ductus arteriosus forms a  connection between two major arteries (the aorta and the pulmonary artery).  This connection normally closes shortly after birth, but it remains open in  babies with. If untreated, this  causes  infants to breathe rapidly, feed poorly, and gain weight slowly. In severe  cases, it can lead to heart failure. People with also  have an increased risk of infection. html:p Hand abnormalities are another feature of Char syndrome. In most people with  this condition, the middle section of the fifth (pinky) finger is shortened or  absent. Other abnormalities of the hands and feet have been reported but are  less common.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common inherited disorder that</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">involves the peripheral nerves, affecting an estimated 150,000 people in the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">United States. It occurs in populations worldwide with a prevalence of about 1</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">in 2,500 individuals.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of progressive disorders that affect the</span>  peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to  muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat,  and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves can result in loss of sensation and  wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands. html:p Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early  adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late  adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity, even among  members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder,  but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of  people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in rare cases, can be  life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth  disease does not affect life expectancy. html:p Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease involve balance  difficulties, clumsiness, and muscle weakness in the feet. Affected individuals  may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes  planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the  foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher  than normal step (or gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. html:p As the disease progresses, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and  foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair. Affected individuals may  also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities  such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with this  disorder typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold  in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations.  In some cases, affected individuals experience gradual hearing loss, deafness,  or loss of vision. html:p There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Type 1  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin,  the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to  conduct nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve  impulses. Type 2 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2) is characterized by  abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body and  transmits nerve impulses. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve  impulse. Type 4 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT4) affects either the axon or  myelin and is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance.  In intermediate forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the nerve impulses are  both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both axons  and myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in  a gene on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various  types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A,  CMT4A, and CMTX1) are distinguished by the specific gene that is altered. html:p Sometimes other, more historical names are used to describe this disorder. For  example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease defined  by the additional feature of  (s). Dejerine-Sottas  syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called Charcot-Marie-Tooth  disease type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this  severe, early onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4.  CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome. Some researchers believe  that this condition is not actually a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.  Instead, they classify it as a separate disorder characterized by peripheral  nerve problems, deafness, and vision loss.

Name1: CHARGE syndrome
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/charge-syndrome
frequency1: CHARGE syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 8,500 to 10,000 newborns.
Description1: html:p CHARGE syndrome is a disorder that affects many areas of the body. CHARGE is an  abbreviation for several of the features common in the disorder: coloboma, heart  defects, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), ,  , and ear abnormalities. The pattern of malformations  varies among individuals with this disorder, and the multiple health problems  can be life-threatening in infancy. Affected individuals usually have several  major characteristics or a combination of major and minor characteristics. html:p The major characteristics of CHARGE syndrome are common in this disorder and  occur less frequently in other disorders. Most individuals with CHARGE syndrome  have a gap or hole in one of the structures of the eye (coloboma), which forms  during early development. A coloboma may be present in one or both eyes and may  impair a person's vision, depending on its size and location. Some affected  individuals also have abnormally small or underdeveloped eyes (microphthalmia).  In many people with CHARGE syndrome, one or both nasal passages are narrowed  (choanal stenosis) or completely blocked (choanal atresia), which can cause  difficulty breathing. Affected individuals frequently have cranial nerve  abnormalities. The cranial nerves emerge directly from the brain and extend to  various areas of the head and neck, controlling muscle movement and transmitting  sensory information. Abnormal function of certain cranial nerves can cause  swallowing problems, facial paralysis, a sense of smell that is diminished  (hyposmia) or completely absent (anosmia), and mild to profound hearing loss.  People with CHARGE syndrome also typically have middle and inner ear  abnormalities, which can contribute to hearing problems, and unusually shaped  external ears. html:p While the minor characteristics of CHARGE syndrome are common in this disorder,  they are also frequently present in people without the disorder. The minor  characteristics include s; ;    and an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of  the mouth (cleft palate). Affected individuals frequently have  , which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual  development. As a result, males with CHARGE syndrome are often born with an  And .  are seen less often in affected females.  Puberty can be incomplete or delayed in affected males and females. Another  minor feature of CHARGE syndrome is tracheoesophageal fistula, which is an  abnormal connection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea. Most people  with CHARGE syndrome also have distinctive facial features, including a  square-shaped face and differences in appearance between the right and left  sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Affected individuals have a wide range of  cognitive function, from normal intelligence to major  disabilities with  absent  and poor . html:p Less common features of CHARGE syndrome include kidney abnormalities; immune  system problems; abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis); and  limb abnormalities, such as extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), missing fingers  or toes (oligodactyly), an inward and upward turning foot (club foot), and  abnormalities of the long bones of the arms and legs.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/chediak-higashi-syndrome
frequency1: Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare disorder. About 200 cases of the condition have been reported worldwide.
Description1: html:p Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body,  particularly the immune system. This disease damages immune system cells,  leaving them less able to fight off invaders such as viruses and bacteria. As a  result, most people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent  infections starting in infancy or early childhood. These infections tend to be  very serious or life-threatening. html:p Chediak-Higashi syndrome is also characterized by a condition called  oculocutaneous albinism, which causes abnormally light coloring (pigmentation)  of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have fair skin and  light-colored hair, often with a metallic sheen. Oculocutaneous albinism also  causes vision problems such as reduced sharpness; rapid, involuntary eye  movements (nystagmus); and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). html:p Many people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have problems with blood clotting  (coagulation) that lead to easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. In adulthood,  Chediak-Higashi syndrome can also affect the nervous system, causing weakness,  clumsiness, difficulty with walking, and . html:p If the disease is not successfully treated, most children with Chediak-Higashi  syndrome reach a stage of the disorder known as the accelerated phase. This  severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by a viral infection. In  the accelerated phase, white blood cells (which normally help fight infection)  divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelerated  phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming  infections, and organ failure. These medical problems are usually  life-threatening in childhood. html:p A small percentage of people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have a milder form of  the condition that appears later in life. People with the adult form of the  disorder have less noticeable changes in pigmentation and are less likely to  have recurrent, severe infections. They do, however, have a significant risk of  progressive neurological problems such as s, difficulty with  , reduced sensation and weakness in the arms and legs  (peripheral neuropathy), and a decline in  functioning.

Description1: html:p Cherubism is a disorder characterized by abnormal bone tissue in the lower part  of the face. Beginning in early childhood, both the lower jaw (the mandible)  and the upper jaw (the maxilla) become enlarged as bone is replaced with  painless, cyst-like growths. These growths give the  appearance and often . In some people  the condition is so mild that it may not be noticeable, while other cases are  severe enough to cause problems with vision, breathing, , and swallowing.  Enlargement of the jaw usually continues throughout childhood and stabilizes  during puberty. The abnormal growths are gradually replaced with normal bone in  early adulthood. As a result, many affected adults have a normal facial  appearance. html:p Most people with cherubism have few, if any, signs and symptoms affecting other  parts of the body. Rarely, however, this condition occurs as part of another  genetic disorder. For example, cherubism can occur with Ramon syndrome, which  also involves ,  disability, and overgrowth of the gums  (gingival fibrosis). Additionally, cherubism has been reported in rare cases  of Noonan syndrome (a  characterized by unusual facial  characteristics, , and s) and fragile X syndrome (a  condition primarily affecting males that causes  disabilities and  cognitive impairment).

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Cholangiocarcinoma is a group of cancers that begin in the bile ducts. Bile</span>  ducts are branched tubes that connect the liver and gallbladder to the small  intestine. They carry bile, which is a fluid that helps the body digest the fats  in food. Bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder before  being released in the small intestine after a person eats. html:p Cholangiocarcinoma is classified by its location in relation to the liver.  Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma begins in the small bile ducts within the liver.  This is the least common form of the disease, accounting for less than 10  percent of all cases. Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (also known as a Klatskin  tumor) begins in an area called the hilum, where two major bile ducts join and  leave the liver. It is the most common form of the disease, accounting for more  than half of all cases. The remaining cases are classified as distal  cholangiocarcinomas, which begin in bile ducts outside the liver. The perihilar  and distal forms of the disease, which both occur outside the liver, are  sometimes grouped together and called extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. html:p The three types of cholangiocarcinoma do not usually cause any symptoms in their  early stages, and this cancer is usually not diagnosed until it has already  spread beyond the bile ducts to other tissues. Symptoms often result when bile  ducts become blocked by the tumor. The most common symptom is jaundice, which is  a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Other symptoms can include  itching, dark-colored urine, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss,  abdominal pain, and light-colored and greasy stools. These symptoms are  described as"nonspecific"because they can be features of many different  diseases. html:p Most people who develop cholangiocarcinoma are older than 65. Because this  cancer is often not discovered until it has already spread, it can be  challenging to treat effectively. Affected individuals can survive for several  months to several years after diagnosis.

Description1: html:p A chordoma is a rare type of cancerous tumor that can occur anywhere along the  spine, from the base of the skull to the tailbone. Chordomas grow slowly,  gradually extending into the bone and soft tissue around them. They often recur  after treatment, and in about 40 percent of cases the cancer spreads  (metastasizes) to other areas of the body, such as the lungs. html:p Approximately half of all chordomas occur at the base of the spine (sacrum),  about one third occur in the base of the skull (occiput), and the rest occur in  the cervical (neck), thoracic (upper back), or lumbar (lower back) vertebrae of  the spine. As the chordoma grows, it puts pressure on the adjacent areas of the  brain or spinal cord, leading to the signs and symptoms of the disorder. A  chordoma anywhere along the spine may cause pain, weakness, or numbness in the  back, arms, or legs. A chordoma at the base of the skull (occipital chordoma)  may lead to double vision (diplopia) and headaches.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/chorea-acanthocytosis
frequency1: It is estimated that 500 to 1,000 people worldwide have chorea-acanthocytosis.
Description1: html:p Chorea-acanthocytosis is primarily a neurological disorder that affects movement  in many parts of the body. Chorea refers to the involuntary jerking movements  made by people with this disorder. People with this condition also have  abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis). This condition is one of  a group of conditions called neuroacanthocytoses that involve neurological  problems and abnormal red blood cells. html:p In addition to chorea, another common feature of chorea-acanthocytosis is  involuntary, such as those in the limbs,  face, mouth, tongue, and throat. These muscle twitches can cause vocal tics  (such as grunting), involuntary belching, and limb spasms. Eating can also be  impaired as tongue and throat twitches can interfere with chewing and swallowing  food. People with chorea-acanthocytosis may uncontrollably bite their tongue,  lips, and inside of the mouth. Nearly half of all people with  chorea-acanthocytosis have . html:p Individuals with chorea-acanthocytosis may develop difficulty processing,  , and remembering information (cognitive impairment). They may have  reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy)  and muscle weakness (myopathy). Impaired muscle and nerve functioning commonly  cause  difficulties in individuals with this condition, and can lead to an  inability to speak. html:p changes are a common feature of chorea-acanthocytosis and may be the  first sign of this condition. These  changes may include changes in  personality, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), lack of self-restraint, and  the inability to take care of oneself. html:p The signs and symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis usually begin in early to  mid-adulthood. The movement problems of this condition worsen with age. Loss  of cells (atrophy) in certain brain regions is the major cause of the  neurological problems seen in people with chorea-acanthocytosis.

Description1: html:p Choroideremia is a condition characterized by progressive vision loss that  mainly affects males. The first symptom of this condition is usually an  impairment of night vision (night blindness), which can occur in early  childhood. A progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision)  follows, as well as a decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity).  These vision problems are due to an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the  specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retina) and a  nearby network of blood vessels (the choroid). The vision impairment in  choroideremia worsens over time, but the progression varies among affected  individuals. However, all individuals with this condition will develop  blindness, most commonly in late adulthood.

frequency1: The prevalence of CAID is unknown. At least 17 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Chronic atrial and intestinal dysrhythmia (CAID) is a disorder affecting the  heart and the digestive system. CAID disrupts the normal rhythm of the  heartbeat; affected individuals have a heart rhythm abnormality called sick  sinus syndrome. The disorder also impairs the rhythmic muscle contractions that  propel food through the intestines (peristalsis), causing a digestive condition  called intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The heart and digestive issues develop at  the same time, usually by age 20. html:p Sick sinus syndrome (also known as sinus node dysfunction) is an abnormality of  the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart  that functions as a natural pacemaker. The SA node generates electrical impulses  that start each heartbeat. These signals travel from the SA node to the rest of  the heart, signaling the heart (cardiac) muscle to contract and pump blood. In  people with sick sinus syndrome, the SA node does not function normally, which  usually causes the heartbeat to be too slow (bradycardia), although occasionally  the heartbeat is too fast (tachycardia) or rapidly switches from being too fast  to being too slow (tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). Symptoms related to  abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope),  a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), and  confusion or memory problems. During exercise, many affected individuals  experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive tiredness (fatigue). html:p In intestinal pseudo-obstruction, impairment of peristalsis leads to a buildup  of partially digested food in the intestines, abdominal swelling (distention)  and pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation or diarrhea. Affected individuals  experience loss of appetite and impaired ability to absorb nutrients, which may  lead to malnutrition. These symptoms resemble those caused by an intestinal  blockage (obstruction) such as a tumor, but in intestinal pseudo-obstruction no  such blockage is found.

frequency1: Chronic granulomatous disease is estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 to 250,000 people worldwide.
Description1: html:p Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to  malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are  conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from  foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic  granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People  with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various  tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic  granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some  individuals do not show symptoms until later in life. html:p People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious  bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most  frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition.  Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal  pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath  after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves.  Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their  decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal  infections in their lungs. Other common areas of infection in people with  chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes. html:p Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with  chronic granulomatous disease. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the  gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal  wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in  severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and  vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic  granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the  mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal  tract can lead to tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses). Inflammation  in the stomach can prevent food from passing through to the intestines (gastric  outlet obstruction), leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive  problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary  tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the  lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis), which both produce  immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system. html:p Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders,  which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own  tissues and organs. html:p Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of  individuals with chronic granulomatous disease; however, with treatment, most  affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Chronic myeloid leukemia is a slow-growing cancer of the blood-forming tissue</span>  (bone marrow). Normal bone marrow produces red blood cells (erythrocytes) that  carry oxygen, white blood cells (leukocytes) that protect the body from  infection, and platelets (thrombocytes) that are involved in blood clotting. In  chronic myeloid leukemia, the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells.  Initially, these cells function relatively normally. However, as the condition  progresses, immature white blood cells called myeloblasts (or blasts) accumulate  in the blood and bone marrow. The overgrowth of myeloblasts impairs development  of other blood cells, leading to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and  platelets. html:p Chronic myeloid leukemia usually begins after age 60. Common features include  excessive tiredness (fatigue), fever, and weight loss. Many affected individuals  develop an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), which can cause a feeling of  fullness in the abdomen and a loss of appetite. About half of people with  chronic myeloid leukemia do not initially have any signs and symptoms and are  diagnosed when a blood test is performed for another reason. html:p The condition consists of three phases: the chronic phase, the accelerated  phase, and the blast phase (or blast crisis). In the chronic phase, the number  of mature white blood cells is elevated, and myeloblasts account for less than  10 percent of blood cells. Signs and symptoms of the condition during this phase  are typically mild or absent and worsen slowly. The chronic phase can last from  months to years. In the accelerated phase, the number of myeloblasts is  slightly higher, making up 10 to 29 percent of blood cells. The signs and  symptoms continue to worsen. The accelerated phase usually lasts 4 to 6 months,  although it is skipped in some affected individuals. In blast crisis, 30 percent  or more of blood or bone marrow cells are myeloblasts. Signs and symptoms are  most severe in this phase, including a massively enlarged spleen, bone pain, and  weight loss. Serious infections and uncontrolled bleeding can be  life-threatening.

Description1: html:p Chylomicron retention disease is an inherited disorder that affects the  absorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and certain fat-soluble vitamins. As  food is digested after a meal, molecules called chylomicrons are formed to carry  fat and cholesterol from the intestine into the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are  also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins, such as  vitamin E and vitamin D. A lack of chylomicron transport causes severely  decreased absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins.  Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal  growth and development. html:p The signs and symptoms of chylomicron retention disease appear in the first few  months of life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected  rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; and fatty, foul-smelling stools  (steatorrhea). Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood  and often impair the function of the nervous system. Affected people may  eventually develop decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia) and a decreased ability to  feel vibrations.

Type II citrullinemia is found primarily in the Japanese population, where it occurs in an estimated 1 in 100,000 to 230,000 individuals. Type II also has been reported in other populations, including other people from East Asia, the Middle East, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Description1: html:p Citrullinemia is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic  substances to accumulate in the blood. Two types of citrullinemia have been  described; they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in  different genes. html:p Type I citrullinemia (also known as classic citrullinemia) usually becomes  evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal  at birth, but as ammonia builds up, they experience a progressive lack of energy  (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, , and loss of consciousness. Some  affected individuals develop serious liver problems. The health problems  associated with type I citrullinemia are life-threatening in many cases. Less  commonly, a milder form of type I citrullinemia can develop later in childhood  or adulthood. This later-onset form is associated with intense headaches, blind  spots (scotomas), , and  lethargy. Some people with gene mutations that cause type I citrullinemia never  experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. html:p Type II citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion,  restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors (such as , irritability,  and ), , and coma. Affected individuals often have  specific food preferences, preferring protein-rich and fatty foods and avoiding  carbohydrate-rich foods. The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically  appear during adulthood (adult-onset) and can be triggered by certain  medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake. These signs and symptoms  can be life-threatening in people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia. html:p Adult-onset type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had  a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin  deficiency (NICCD). This liver condition is also known as neonatal-onset type II  citrullinemia. NICCD blocks the flow of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the  liver) and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. In  many cases, the signs and symptoms of NICCD go away within a year. In rare  cases, affected individuals develop other signs and symptoms in early childhood  after seeming to recover from NICCD, including , extreme tiredness  (fatigue), specific food preferences (mentioned above), and abnormal amounts of  fats (lipids) in the blood (dyslipidemia). This condition is known as failure  to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Years or even  decades later, some people with NICCD or FTTDCD develop the features of  adult-onset type II citrullinemia.

Signs and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia can vary widely  in severity, even within the same family. html:p Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia usually have underdeveloped or absent  collarbones, also called clavicles ("cleido-"in the condition name refers to  these bones). As a result, their shoulders are narrow and sloping, can be  brought unusually close together in front of the body, and in some cases can be  made to meet in the middle of the body. Delayed maturation of the skull  (cranium) is also characteristic of this condition, including delayed closing of  the growth lines where the bones of the skull meet (sutures) and larger than  normal spaces (fontanelles) between the skull bones that are noticeable as"soft  spots"on the heads of infants. The fontanelles normally close in early  childhood, but they may remain open throughout life in people with this  disorder. Some individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia have extra pieces of  bone called Wormian bones within the sutures. html:p Affected individuals are often shorter than other members of their family at the  same age. Many also have short, tapered fingers and broad thumbs; flat feet;  bowed legs or knock knees; short shoulder blades (scapulae); and an abnormal  curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Typical facial features include a wide,  short skull (brachycephaly); a prominent forehead; wide-set eyes  (hypertelorism); a flat nose; and a small upper jaw. html:p Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia often have decreased bone density  (osteopenia) and may develop osteoporosis, a condition that makes bones  progressively more brittle and prone to fracture, at a relatively early age.  Women with cleidocranial dysplasia have an increased risk of requiring a  cesarean section when delivering a baby, due to a narrow pelvis preventing  passage of the infant's head. html:p Dental abnormalities are very common in cleidocranial dysplasia and can include  delayed loss of the primary (baby) teeth; delayed appearance of the secondary  (adult) teeth; unusually shaped, peg-like teeth; misalignment of the teeth and  jaws (malocclusion); and extra teeth, sometimes accompanied by cysts in the  gums. html:p In addition to skeletal and dental abnormalities, people with cleidocranial  dysplasia may have hearing loss and are prone to sinus and ear infections. Some  young children with this condition are mildly  , but intelligence is unaffected.

Intermediate metabolizers are  able to process some clopidogrel, so they receive partial benefit from the  treatment but are not protected from developing a harmful blood clot. Poor  metabolizers process little or no clopidogrel, so they receive very limited  benefit from the treatment and are at risk of forming a harmful blood clot. html:p Clopidogrel resistance does not appear to cause any health problems other than  those associated with clopidogrel drug treatment.

Description1: html:p Clouston syndrome is a form of ectodermal dysplasia, a group of about 150  conditions characterized by abnormal development of some or all of the  ectodermal structures, which include the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat  glands. Specifically, Clouston syndrome is characterized by abnormalities of the  hair, nails, and skin, with the teeth and sweat glands being unaffected. html:p In infants with Clouston syndrome, scalp hair is sparse, patchy, and lighter in  color than the hair of other family members; it is also fragile and easily  broken. By puberty, the hair problems may worsen until all the hair on the scalp  is lost (total alopecia). The eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm (axillary) hair,  and pubic hair are also sparse or absent. html:p Abnormal growth of fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy) is also  characteristic of Clouston syndrome. The nails may appear white in the first  years of life. They grow slowly and gradually become thick and misshapen. In  some people with Clouston syndrome, nail dystrophy is the most noticeable  feature of the disorder. html:p Many people with Clouston syndrome have thick skin on the palms of the hands and  soles of the feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis); areas of the skin, especially  over the joints, that are darker in color than the surrounding skin  (hyperpigmentation); and widened and rounded tips of the fingers (clubbing).

Description1: html:p CLPB deficiency is a rare disorder characterized by neurological problems and a  shortage of infection-fighting white blood cells (neutropenia). Signs and  symptoms of the condition develop by early childhood, and their severity varies  widely among affected individuals. html:p In the most severely affected individuals, features of CLPB deficiency are  apparent in infancy and sometimes at birth. Affected babies have serious  neurological problems, which can include an exaggerated startle reaction  (hyperekplexia) to unexpected stimuli such as loud noises, reduced movement,  muscle tone that is either decreased () or increased (hypertonia),  swallowing problems, difficulty breathing, and recurrent  ().  These babies may also have movement abnormalities, such as difficulty  S , involuntary ,  or uncontrolled movements of the body (dyskinesia). In addition, these babies  have recurrent, life-threatening infections due to severe neutropenia. Affected  individuals are at risk of developing a blood cell disorder called  myelodysplastic syndrome or a form of blood cancer called leukemia. Because of  their severe health problems, affected infants usually live only a few weeks or  months. html:p Moderately affected individuals have neurological problems similar to those  described above, although they are less severe. They include ,  , and movement abnormalities. Other features of moderate  CLPB deficiency include  and mild to severe  disability.  Neutropenia in these individuals can lead to recurrent infections, although they  are not life-threatening. html:p Mildly affected individuals have no neurological problems, and although they  have neutropenia, it does not increase the risk of infections. Some people with  mild CLPB deficiency develop deposits of calcium in the kidneys  (nephrocalcinosis) or kidney (renal) cysts. html:p Many people with mild, moderate, or severe CLPB deficiency have clouding of the  lenses of the eyes (cataracts) from birth (congenital) or beginning in infancy. html:p CLPB deficiency is associated with increased levels of a substance called  3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria). This  abnormality, which provides a clue to the diagnosis, does not appear to cause  any health problems.

frequency1: Coats plus syndrome appears to be a rare disorder. Its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Coats plus syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by an eye disorder  called Coats disease plus abnormalities of the brain, bones, gastrointestinal  system, and other parts of the body. html:p Coats disease affects the retina, which is the tissue at the back of the eye  that detects light and color. The disorder causes blood vessels in the retina to  be abnormally enlarged (dilated) and twisted. The abnormal vessels leak fluid,  which can eventually cause the layers of the retina to separate (retinal  detachment). These eye abnormalities often result in vision loss. html:p People with Coats plus syndrome also have brain abnormalities including abnormal  deposits of calcium (calcification), the development of fluid-filled pockets  called cysts, and loss of a type of brain tissue known as white matter  (leukodystrophy). These brain abnormalities worsen over time, causing  , movement disorders, , and a decline in  function. html:p Other features of Coats plus syndrome include low bone density (osteopenia),  which causes bones to be fragile and break easily, and a shortage of red blood  cells (anemia), which can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor) and extreme  tiredness (fatigue). Affected individuals can also have serious or  life-threatening complications including abnormal bleeding in the  gastrointestinal tract, high blood pressure in the vein that supplies blood to  the liver (portal hypertension), and liver failure. Less common features of  Coats plus syndrome can include sparse, prematurely gray hair; malformations of  the fingernails and toenails; and abnormalities of skin coloring (pigmentation),  such as light brown patches called café-au-lait spots. html:p Coats plus syndrome and a disorder called leukoencephalopathy with  calcifications and cysts (LCC; also called Labrune syndrome) have sometimes been  grouped together under the umbrella term cerebroretinal microangiopathy with  calcifications and cysts (CRMCC) because they feature very similar brain  abnormalities. However, researchers recently found that Coats plus syndrome and  LCC have different genetic causes, and they are now generally described as  separate disorders instead of variants of a single condition.

Description1: html:p Cold-induced sweating syndrome is characterized by problems with regulating body  temperature and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body. In  infancy, the features of this condition are often known as Crisponi syndrome.  Researchers originally thought that cold-induced sweating syndrome and Crisponi  syndrome were separate disorders, but it is now widely believed that they  represent the same condition at different times during life. html:p Infants with Crisponi syndrome have unusual facial features, including a flat  nasal bridge, upturned nostrils, a long space between the nose and upper lip  (philtrum), a high arched roof of the mouth (palate), a small chin  (micrognathia), and low-set ears. The muscles in the lower part of the face are  weak, leading to severe feeding difficulties, excessive drooling, and breathing  problems. Other physical abnormalities associated with Crisponi syndrome include  a scaly skin rash, an inability to fully extend the elbows, overlapping fingers  and tightly fisted hands, and malformations of the feet and toes. Affected  infants startle easily and often tense their facial muscles into a grimace-like  expression. By six months of age, infants with Crisponi syndrome develop  unexplained high fevers that increase the risk of  and sudden death. html:p Many of the health problems associated with Crisponi syndrome improve with time,  and affected individuals who survive the newborn period go on to develop other  features of cold-induced sweating syndrome in early childhood. Within the first  decade of life, affected individuals begin having episodes of profuse sweating  (hyperhidrosis) and shivering involving the face, torso, and arms. The excessive  sweating is usually triggered by exposure to temperatures below about 65 or 70  degrees Fahrenheit, but it can also be triggered by nervousness or eating sugary  foods. Paradoxically, affected individuals tend not to sweat in warmer  conditions, instead becoming flushed and overheated in hot environments. html:p Adolescents with cold-induced sweating syndrome typically develop abnormal  side-to-side and front-to-back curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis,  often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur together). Although infants may  develop life-threatening fevers, affected individuals who survive infancy have a  normal life expectancy.

Name1: Collagen VI-related myopathy
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/collagen-vi-related-myopathy
frequency1: Collagen VI-related myopathy is rare. Bethlem myopathy is estimated to occur in 0.77 per 100,000 individuals, and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is estimated to occur in 0.13 per 100,000 individuals. Only a few cases of the intermediate form have been described in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Collagen VI-related myopathy is a group of disorders that affect skeletal  muscles (which are the muscles used for movement) and connective tissue (which  provides strength and flexibility to the skin, joints, and other structures  throughout the body). Most affected individuals have  and  that restrict movement of the affected joints  and worsen over time. Researchers have described several forms of collagen  VI-related myopathy, which range in severity: Bethlem myopathy is the mildest,  an intermediate form is moderate in severity, and Ullrich congenital muscular  dystrophy is the most severe. html:p People with Bethlem myopathy usually have  and  () in infancy, but they develop during  childhood, typically in their fingers, wrists, elbows, and ankles. Muscle  weakness can begin at any age but often appears in childhood to early adulthood.  The muscle weakness is slowly progressive, with about two-thirds of affected  individuals over age 50 needing walking assistance. Older individuals may  develop weakness in respiratory muscles, which can cause breathing problems.  Some people with this mild form of collagen VI-related myopathy have skin  abnormalities, including small bumps called follicular hyperkeratosis on the  arms and legs; soft, velvety skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the  feet; and abnormal wound healing that creates shallow scars. html:p The intermediate form of collagen VI-related myopathy is characterized by muscle  weakness that begins in infancy. Affected children are able to walk, although  walking becomes increasingly difficult starting in early adulthood. They develop  in childhood. In some  affected people, the respiratory muscles are weakened, requiring people to use a  machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation), particularly during  sleep. html:p People with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy have severe muscle weakness  beginning soon after birth. Some affected individuals are never able to walk and  others can walk only with support. Those who can walk often lose the ability,  usually in adolescence. Individuals with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy  develop, which further impair  movement. There may be  . Some affected individuals need continuous mechanical ventilation  to help them breathe. As in Bethlem myopathy, some people with Ullrich  congenital muscular dystrophy have follicular hyperkeratosis; soft, velvety skin  on the palms and soles; and abnormal wound healing. html:p Individuals with collagen VI-related myopathy often have signs and symptoms of  multiple forms of this condition, so it can be difficult to assign a specific  diagnosis. The overlap in disease features, in addition to their common cause,  is why these once separate conditions are now considered part of the same  disease spectrum.

Name1: Coloboma
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/coloboma
frequency1: Coloboma occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 people. Because coloboma does not always affect vision or the outward appearance of the eye, some people with this condition are likely undiagnosed.
Description1: html:p Coloboma is an eye abnormality that occurs before birth. Colobomas are missing  pieces of tissue in structures that form the eye. They may appear as notches or  gaps in one of several parts of the eye, including the colored part of the eye  called the iris; the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue  that lines the back of the eye; the blood vessel layer under the retina called  the choroid; or the optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the  brain. html:p Colobomas may be present in one or both eyes and, depending on their size and  location, can affect a person's vision. Colobomas affecting the iris, which  result in a"keyhole"appearance of the pupil, generally do not lead to vision  loss. Colobomas involving the retina result in vision loss in specific parts of  the visual field, generally the upper part. Large retinal colobomas or those  affecting the optic nerve can cause low vision, which means vision loss that  cannot be completely corrected with glasses or contact lenses. html:p Some people with coloboma also have a condition called microphthalmia. In this  condition, one or both eyeballs are abnormally small. In some affected  individuals, the eyeball may appear to be completely missing; however, even in  these cases some remaining eye tissue is generally present. Such severe  microphthalmia should be distinguished from another condition called  anophthalmia, in which no eyeball forms at all. However, the terms anophthalmia  and severe microphthalmia are often used interchangeably. Microphthalmia may or  may not result in significant vision loss. html:p People with coloboma may also have other eye abnormalities, including clouding  of the lens of the eye (cataract), increased pressure inside the eye (glaucoma)  that can damage the optic nerve, vision problems such as nearsightedness  (myopia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), or separation of  the retina from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). html:p Some individuals have coloboma as part of a syndrome that affects other organs  and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as  syndromic. When coloboma occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic or  isolated. html:p Colobomas involving the eyeball should be distinguished from gaps that occur in  the eyelids. While these eyelid gaps are also called colobomas, they arise from  abnormalities in different structures during early development.

frequency1: The prevalence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 8,000 individuals worldwide.
Description1: html:p Combined pituitary hormone deficiency is a condition that causes a shortage  (deficiency) of several hormones produced by the pituitary gland, which is  located at the base of the brain. A lack of these hormones may affect the  development of many parts of the body. The first signs of this condition include  a failure to grow at the expected rate and  that usually becomes  apparent in early childhood. html:p People with combined pituitary hormone deficiency may have hypothyroidism, which  is underactivity of the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland in the lower neck.  Hypothyroidism can cause many symptoms, including weight gain and fatigue. Other  features of combined pituitary hormone deficiency include delayed or absent  puberty and lack the ability to have biological children (infertility). The  condition can also be associated with a deficiency of the hormone cortisol.  Cortisol deficiency can impair the body's immune system, causing individuals to  be more susceptible to infection. html:p Rarely, people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency have  disability; a short, stiff neck; or underdeveloped optic nerves, which carry  visual information from the eyes to the brain.

frequency1: CVID is estimated to affect 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide, although the prevalence can vary across different populations.
Description1: html:p Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a disorder that impairs the immune  system. People with CVID are highly susceptible to infection from foreign  invaders such as bacteria, or more rarely, viruses and often develop recurrent  infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Pneumonia is common in  people with CVID. Over time, recurrent infections can lead to chronic lung  disease. Affected individuals may also experience infection or inflammation of  the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause diarrhea and weight loss. Abnormal  accumulation of immune cells causes enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an  enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) in some people with CVID. Immune cells can  accumulate in other organs, forming small lumps called granulomas. html:p Approximately 25 percent of people with CVID have an autoimmune disorder, which  occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and  organs. The blood cells are most frequently affected by autoimmune attacks in  CVID; the most commonly occurring autoimmune disorders are immune  thrombocytopenia purpura, which is an abnormal bleeding disorder caused by a  decrease in cell fragments involved in blood clotting called platelets, and  autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which results in premature destruction of red blood  cells. Other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis can occur.  Individuals with CVID also have a greater than normal risk of developing certain  types of cancer, including a cancer of immune system cells called non-Hodgkin  lymphoma and less frequently, stomach (gastric) cancer. html:p People with CVID may start experiencing signs and symptoms of the disorder  anytime between childhood and adulthood; most people with CVID are diagnosed in  their twenties or thirties. The life expectancy of individuals with CVID varies  depending on the severity and frequency of illnesses they experience. Most  people with CVID live into adulthood. html:p There are many different types of CVID that are distinguished by genetic cause.  People with the same type of CVID may have varying signs and symptoms.

frequency1: In Western countries, complement component 2 deficiency is estimated to affect 1 in 20,000 individuals; its prevalence in other areas of the world is unknown.
Description1: html:p Complement component 2 deficiency is a disorder that causes the immune system to  malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are  conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body  effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. People with  complement component 2 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of  recurrent bacterial infections, specifically of the lungs (pneumonia), the  membrane covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), and the blood  (sepsis), which may be life-threatening. These infections most commonly occur in  infancy and childhood and become less frequent in adolescence and adulthood. html:p Complement component 2 deficiency is also associated with an increased risk of  developing autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or  vasculitis. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and  attacks the body's tissues and organs. Between 10 and 20 percent of individuals  with complement component 2 deficiency develop SLE. Females with complement  component 2 deficiency are more likely to have SLE than affected males, but this  is also true of SLE in the general population. html:p The severity of complement component 2 deficiency varies widely. While some  affected individuals experience recurrent infections and other immune system  difficulties, others do not have any health problems related to the disorder.

frequency1: Complete LCAT deficiency is a rare disorder. Approximately 70 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Complete LCAT deficiency is a disorder that primarily affects the eyes and  kidneys. html:p In complete LCAT deficiency, the clear front surface of the eyes (the corneas)  gradually becomes cloudy. The cloudiness, which generally first appears in early  childhood, consists of small grayish dots of cholesterol (opacities)  distributed across the corneas. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that  is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals; it aids  in many functions of the body but can become harmful in excessive amounts. As  complete LCAT deficiency progresses, the corneal cloudiness worsens and can lead  to severely impaired vision. html:p People with complete LCAT deficiency often have kidney disease that begins in  adolescence or early adulthood. The kidney problems get worse over time and may  eventually lead to kidney failure. Individuals with this disorder also usually  have a condition known as hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken  down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells  (anemia). Anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious  complications. html:p Other features of complete LCAT deficiency that occur in some affected  individuals include enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), spleen  (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an accumulation of fatty  deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis).

frequency1: Cone-rod dystrophy is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 to 40,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Cone-rod dystrophy is a group of related eye disorders that causes vision loss,  which becomes more severe over time. These disorders affect the retina, which is  the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In people with  cone-rod dystrophy, vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina  gradually deteriorate. html:p The first signs and symptoms of cone-rod dystrophy, which often occur in  childhood, are usually decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and  increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). These features are typically  followed by impaired color vision (dyschromatopsia), blind spots (scotomas) in  the center of the visual field, and partial side (peripheral) vision loss. Over  time, affected individuals develop night blindness and a worsening of their  peripheral vision, which can limit independent mobility. Decreasing visual  acuity makes reading increasingly difficult and most affected individuals are  legally blind by mid-adulthood. As the condition progresses, individuals may  develop involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). html:p There are more than 30 types of cone-rod dystrophy, which are distinguished by  their genetic cause and their pattern of inheritance: autosomal recessive,  autosomal dominant, and X-linked. Additionally, cone-rod dystrophy can occur  alone without any other signs and symptoms or it can occur as part of a syndrome  that affects multiple parts of the body.

frequency1: CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 5 to 8 percent of all cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It is estimated that CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency occurs in 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns. This <span style="background:#FFFF00;">condition is more common in Moroccan Jews living in Israel, occurring in</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">approximately 1 in 5,000 to 7,000 newborns.

Description1: html:p Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is  one of a group of disorders (collectively called congenital adrenal hyperplasia)  that affect the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of the  kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions  in the body. In people with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, the  adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones. html:p There are two types of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, the classic  form and the non-classic form. The classic form is the more severe of the two  types. html:p Females with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have    . However, the internal reproductive organs develop normally. Males  and females with the classic form of this condition have early development of  their secondary sexual characteristics such as growth of facial and pubic hair,  deepening of the voice, appearance of acne, and onset of a growth spurt. The  early growth spurt can prevent growth later in adolescence and lead to  in adulthood. In addition, approximately two-thirds of individuals with  the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have high blood  pressure (hypertension). Hypertension typically develops within the first year  of life. html:p Females with the non-classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency  have normal female genitalia. As affected females get older, they may develop  excessive body hair growth (hirsutism) and irregular menstruation. Males with  the non-classic form of this condition do not typically have any signs or  symptoms except for .

Description1: html:p Congenital afibrinogenemia is a bleeding disorder caused by impairment of the  blood clotting process. Normally, blood clots protect the body after an injury  by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. However,  bleeding is uncontrolled in people with congenital afibrinogenemia. Newborns  with this condition often experience prolonged bleeding from the umbilical cord  stump after birth. Nosebleeds (epistaxis) and bleeding from the gums or tongue  are common and can occur after minor trauma or in the absence of injury  (spontaneous bleeding). Some affected individuals experience bleeding into the  spaces between joints (hemarthrosis) or the muscles (hematoma). Rarely, bleeding  in the brain or other internal organs occurs, which can be fatal. Women with  congenital afibrinogenemia can have abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding  (menorrhagia). Without proper treatment, women with this disorder may have  difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term, resulting in repeated miscarriages.

frequency1: The prevalence of congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1 is unknown; however, it is the most common of all the congenital defects of bile acid synthesis. Together, these conditions are thought to have a prevalence of 1 to 9 per million people.
Description1: html:p Congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1 is a disorder characterized by  cholestasis, a condition that impairs the production and release of a digestive  fluid called bile from liver cells. Bile is used during digestion to absorb fats  and fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. People with  congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1 cannot produce (synthesize) bile  acids, which are a component of bile that stimulate bile flow and help it absorb  fats and fat-soluble vitamins. As a result, an abnormal form of bile is  produced. html:p The signs and symptoms of congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1 often  develop during the first weeks of life, but they can begin anytime from infancy  into adulthood. Affected infants often have a failure to gain weight and grow at  the expected rate (failure to thrive) and yellowing of the skin and eyes  (jaundice) due to impaired bile flow and a buildup of partially formed bile.  Excess fat in the feces (steatorrhea) is an additional feature of congenital  bile acid synthesis defect type 1. As the condition progresses, affected  individuals can develop liver abnormalities including an enlarged liver  (hepatomegaly), inflammation, or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The spleen  may also become enlarged (splenomegaly). The inability to absorb certain  fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin D in particular) can result in softening and  weakening of the bones (rickets) in some individuals. html:p If left untreated, congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1 often leads to  cirrhosis and death in childhood.

frequency1: The prevalence of CCFDN is unknown. The disorder has been identified in about 150 individuals of Romani ethnicity. Thus far, no affected individuals have been observed outside this community.
Description1: html:p Congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism, and neuropathy (CCFDN) is a rare  disorder that affects several parts of the body. It is characterized by a  clouding of the lens of the eyes at birth (congenital cataracts) and other eye  abnormalities, such as small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia) and  abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Affected individuals, particularly males,  often have distinctive facial features that become more apparent as they reach  adulthood. These features include a prominent midface, a large nose, protruding  teeth, and a small lower jaw. html:p CCFDN causes progressive damage to the peripheral nerves, which connect the  brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells. This nerve damage is known  as peripheral neuropathy. Weakness in the legs, followed by the arms, begins in  the first few years of life, and as a result children with CCFDN have  . In adolescence,  affected individuals develop sensory abnormalities such as numbness and  tingling, mainly in the legs. By adulthood they typically have significant  difficulties with mobility. Muscle weakness can also lead to skeletal  abnormalities such as hand and foot deformities and abnormal curvature of the  spine. html:p People with CCFDN may have ,  s, and difficulty with movements that involve judging distance or scale  (dysmetria). Some have mild  disability. Individuals with CCFDN have  , are typically underweight, and have reduced bone density. html:p A complication called rhabdomyolysis occurs in some people with CCFDN, typically  following a viral infection or, in rare cases, during or after surgery.  Rhabdomyolysis is a breakdown of muscle tissue that results in severe muscle  weakness. The destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin,  which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). The  presence of myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown. The muscles may take  up to a year to recover, and the episodes may worsen the muscle weakness caused  by the neuropathy.

frequency1: CCHS is a relatively rare disorder. Approximately 1,000 individuals with this condition have been identified. Researchers believe that some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or sudden unexplained death in children may be caused by undiagnosed CCHS.
Description1: html:p Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder that affects  breathing. People with this disorder take shallow breaths (hypoventilate),  especially during sleep, resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of  carbon dioxide in the blood. Ordinarily, the part of the nervous system that  controls involuntary body processes (autonomic nervous system) would react to  such an imbalance by stimulating the individual to breathe more deeply or wake  up. This reaction is impaired in people with CCHS, and they must be supported  with a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation) or a device that  stimulates a normal breathing pattern (diaphragm pacemaker). Some affected  individuals need this support 24 hours a day, while others need it only at  night. html:p Symptoms of CCHS usually become apparent shortly after birth. Affected infants  hypoventilate upon falling asleep and exhibit a bluish appearance of the skin or  lips (cyanosis). Cyanosis is caused by lack of oxygen in the blood. In some  milder cases, CCHS may be diagnosed later in life. In addition to the breathing  problem, people with this disorder may have difficulty regulating their heart  rate and blood pressure, for example in response to exercise or changes in body  position. They may have abnormalities in the nerves that control the digestive  tract (Hirschsprung disease), resulting in severe constipation, intestinal  blockage, and enlargement of the colon. They are also at increased risk of  developing certain tumors of the nervous system called neuroblastomas,  ganglioneuromas, and ganglioneuroblastomas. Some affected individuals develop  difficulties or other neurological problems, which may be worsened by  oxygen deprivation if treatment to support their breathing is not completely  effective. html:p Individuals with CCHS usually have eye abnormalities, including a decreased  response of the pupils to light. They also have decreased perception of pain,  low body temperature, and occasional episodes of profuse sweating. html:p People with CCHS, especially children, may have a characteristic appearance with  a short, wide, somewhat flattened face often described as"box-shaped."Life  expectancy and the extent of any cognitive disabilities depend on the severity  of the disorder, timing of the diagnosis, and the success of treatment.

The diaphragm,</span>  which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in  the abdomen from those in the chest.  before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to  its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an  abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into  the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to  , potentially resulting in  life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. html:p In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital  diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or  abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about  1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be  detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. html:p Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A  Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80  and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani  hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of  congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of  cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of  congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of  the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin  membrane in its place, are rare.

frequency1: Several hundred cases of CDA have been reported worldwide. CDA type II is the most common form of the disorder, with more than 300 reported cases. CDA type III is the rarest form; it has been described in only a few families from Sweden, Argentina, and the United States. The incidence of CDA type I is unknown. Because CDA is so rare and its signs and symptoms overlap with those of other disorders, many cases likely remain undiagnosed or are incorrectly diagnosed as other disorders.
Description1: html:p Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is an inherited blood disorder that  affects the . This disorder is one of many types  of anemia, which is a condition characterized by a shortage of red blood cells.  This shortage prevents the blood from carrying an adequate supply of oxygen to  the body's tissues. The resulting symptoms can include tiredness (fatigue),  weakness, pale skin, and other complications. html:p Researchers have identified three major types of CDA: type I, type II, and type  III. The types have different genetic causes and different but overlapping  patterns of signs and symptoms. html:p CDA type I is characterized by moderate to severe anemia. It is usually  diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, although in some cases, the condition can  be detected before birth. Many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin  and eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). This  condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can  damage tissues and organs. In particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal  heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver  disease (cirrhosis). Rarely, people with CDA type I are born with skeletal  abnormalities, most often involving the fingers and/or toes. html:p The anemia associated with CDA type II can range from mild to severe, and most  affected individuals have jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and the formation of  hard deposits in the gallbladder called gallstones. This form of the disorder is  usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. An abnormal buildup of  iron typically occurs after age 20, leading to complications including heart  disease, diabetes, and cirrhosis. html:p The signs and symptoms of CDA type III tend to be milder than those of the other  types. Most affected individuals do not have hepatosplenomegaly, and iron does  not build up in tissues and organs. In adulthood, abnormalities of a specialized  tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) can cause vision impairment. Some  people with CDA type III also have a blood disorder known as monoclonal  gammopathy, which can lead to a cancer of white blood cells (multiple myeloma). html:p Several other variants of CDA have been described, although they appear to be  rare and not much is known about them. Once researchers discover the genetic  causes of these variants, some of them may be grouped with the three major types  of CDA.

Description1: html:p Congenital fiber-type disproportion is a condition that primarily affects  skeletal muscles, which are muscles used for movement. People with this  condition typically experience muscle weakness (myopathy), particularly in the  muscles of the shoulders, upper arms, hips, and thighs. Weakness can also affect  the muscles of the face and muscles that control eye movement  (ophthalmoplegia), sometimes causing droopy eyelids (ptosis). Individuals with  congenital fiber-type disproportion generally have a long face, a high arch in  the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), and crowded teeth. Affected  individuals may have and an abnormally curved  lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis).  Approximately 30 percent of people with this disorder experience mild to severe  breathing problems related to weakness of muscles needed for breathing. Some  people who experience these breathing problems require use of a machine to help  regulate their breathing at night (noninvasive mechanical ventilation), and  occasionally during the day as well. About 30 percent of affected individuals  have difficulty swallowing due to muscle weakness in the throat. Rarely, people  with this condition have a weakened and enlarged heart muscle (dilated  cardiomyopathy). html:p The severity of congenital fiber-type disproportion varies widely. It is  estimated that up to 25 percent of affected individuals experience severe muscle  weakness at birth and die in infancy or childhood. Others have only mild muscle  weakness that becomes apparent in adulthood. Most often, the signs and symptoms  of this condition appear by age 1. The first signs of this condition are  usually decreased muscle tone () and muscle weakness. In most cases,  muscle weakness does not worsen over time, and in some instances it may improve.  Although motor skills such as standing and walking may be delayed, many  affected children eventually learn to walk. These individuals often have less  stamina than their peers, but they remain active. Rarely, people with this  condition have a progressive decline in muscle strength over time. These  individuals may lose the ability to walk and require wheelchair assistance.

Between 300 and 500 people with the condition have been described in the medical literature. Although this condition has been <span style="background:#FFFF00;">reported in populations around the world, it appears to be more common in</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">certain regions of Lebanon and Brazil.</span>
Description1: html:p Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital  lipodystrophy) is a rare condition characterized by an almost total lack of  fatty (adipose) tissue in the body and a very muscular appearance. Adipose  tissue is found in many parts of the body, including beneath the skin and  surrounding the internal organs. It stores fat for energy and also provides  cushioning. Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is part of a group of related  disorders known as lipodystrophies, which are all characterized by a loss of  adipose tissue. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to the storage of fat  elsewhere in the body, such as in the liver and muscles, which causes serious  health problems. html:p The signs and symptoms of congenital generalized lipodystrophy are usually  apparent from birth or early childhood. One of the most common features is  insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's tissues are unable to  recognize insulin, a hormone that normally helps to regulate blood sugar levels.  Insulin resistance may develop into a more serious disease called diabetes  mellitus. Most affected individuals also have high levels of fats called  triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia), which can  lead to the  and  Additionally, congenital generalized lipodystrophy causes an abnormal buildup of  fats in the liver (hepatic steatosis), which can result in an enlarged liver  (hepatomegaly) and liver failure. Some affected individuals develop a form of  heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart  failure and an  (arrhythmia) that can cause sudden death. html:p People with congenital generalized lipodystrophy have a distinctive physical  appearance. They appear very muscular because they have an almost complete  absence of adipose tissue and an overgrowth of muscle tissue. A lack of adipose  tissue under the skin also makes the veins appear prominent. Affected  individuals tend to have a large chin, prominent bones above the eyes (orbital  ridges), large hands and feet, and a prominent belly button (umbilicus).  Affected females may have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly), an increased  amount of body hair (hirsutism), irregular menstrual periods, and multiple cysts  on the ovaries, which may be related to hormonal changes. Many people with this  disorder develop acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition related to high levels  of insulin in the bloodstream. Acanthosis nigricans causes the skin in body  folds and creases to become thick, dark, and velvety. html:p Researchers have described four types of congenital generalized lipodystrophy,  which are distinguished by their genetic cause. The types also have some  differences in their typical signs and symptoms. For example, in addition to the  features described above, some people with congenital generalized lipodystrophy  type 1 develop cysts in the long bones of the arms and legs after puberty. Type  2 can be associated with  disability, which is usually mild to  moderate. Type 3 appears to cause  and , along with  other health problems. Type 4 is associated with muscle weakness,  , a narrowing of the lower part of the stomach  (pyloric stenosis), and severe arrhythmia that can lead to sudden death.

frequency1: Isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis is rare. Its prevalence is unknown. The total prevalence of syndromes that include congenital hepatic fibrosis as a feature is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 to 20,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Congenital hepatic fibrosis is a disease of the liver that is present from  birth. The liver has many important functions, including producing various  substances needed by the body and breaking down other substances into smaller  parts to be used or eliminated. html:p Congenital hepatic fibrosis is characterized by malformation of the bile ducts  and the blood vessels of the hepatic portal system. Bile ducts carry bile (a  fluid that helps to digest fats) from the liver to the gallbladder and small  intestine. The hepatic portal system is a branching network of veins (portal  veins) that carry blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver for  processing. html:p A buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the portal tracts also occurs in this  disorder. Portal tracts are structures in the liver that bundle the vessels  through which blood, lymph, and bile flow. Lymph is a fluid that helps exchange  immune cells, proteins, and other substances between the blood and tissues.  Fibrosis in the portal tracts can restrict the normal movement of fluids in  these vessels. html:p Constriction of the portal veins due to malformation and portal tract fibrosis  results in high blood pressure in the hepatic portal system (portal  hypertension). Portal hypertension impairs the flow of blood from the  gastrointestinal tract, causing an increase in pressure in the veins of the  esophagus, stomach, and intestines. These veins may stretch and their walls may  become thin, leading to a risk of abnormal bleeding. html:p People with congenital hepatic fibrosis have an enlarged liver and spleen  (hepatosplenomegaly). The liver is also abnormally shaped. Affected individuals  also have an increased risk of infection of the bile ducts (cholangitis), hard  deposits in the gallbladder or bile ducts (gallstones), and cancer of the liver  or gallbladder. html:p Congenital hepatic fibrosis may occur alone, in which case it is called isolated  congenital hepatic fibrosis. More frequently, it occurs as a feature of genetic  syndromes that also affect the kidneys, such as polycystic kidney disease  (PKD).

frequency1: Congenital hyperinsulinism affects approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns. This condition is more common in certain populations, affecting up to 1 in 2,500 newborns.
Description1: html:p Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have  abnormally high levels of insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood  sugar levels. People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood  sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are  characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty  feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious  complications such as breathing difficulties, ,  disability,  vision loss, brain damage, and coma. html:p The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected  individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants  with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of  life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike  typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without  food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with  congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Congenital hypothyroidism is a partial or complete loss of function of the</span>  thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) that affects infants from birth (congenital). The  thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. It makes  iodine-containing hormones that play an important role in regulating growth,  brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism).  People with congenital hypothyroidism have lower-than-normal levels of these  important hormones. html:p Congenital hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to develop or  function properly. In 80 to 85 percent of cases, the thyroid gland is absent,  severely reduced in size (hypoplastic), or abnormally located. These cases are  classified as thyroid dysgenesis. In the remainder of cases, a normal-sized or  enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is present, but production of thyroid hormones  is decreased or absent. Most of these cases occur when one of several steps in  the hormone synthesis process is impaired; these cases are classified as thyroid  dyshormonogenesis. Less commonly, reduction or absence of thyroid hormone  production is caused by impaired stimulation of the production process (which is  normally done by a structure at the base of the brain called the pituitary  gland), even though the process itself is unimpaired. These cases are classified  as central (or pituitary) hypothyroidism. html:p Signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism result from the shortage of  thyroid hormones. Affected babies may show no features of the condition,  although some babies with congenital hypothyroidism are less active and sleep  more than normal. They may have difficulty feeding and experience constipation.  If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to  disability and  . In the United States and many other countries, all hospitals test  newborns for congenital hypothyroidism. If treatment begins in the first two  weeks after birth, infants usually develop normally. html:p Congenital hypothyroidism can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other  organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as  syndromic. Some common forms of syndromic hypothyroidism include Pendred  syndrome, Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, and brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.

frequency1: Congenital insensitivity to pain is a rare condition; about 20 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Congenital insensitivity to pain is a condition that inhibits the ability to  perceive physical pain. From birth, affected individuals never feel pain in any  part of their body when injured. People with this condition can feel the  difference between sharp and dull and hot and cold, but cannot sense, for  example, that a hot beverage is burning their tongue. This lack of pain  awareness often leads to an accumulation of wounds, bruises, broken bones, and  other health issues that may go undetected. Young children with congenital  insensitivity to pain may have mouth or finger wounds due to repeated  self-biting and may also experience multiple burn-related injuries. These  repeated injuries often lead to a reduced life expectancy in people with  congenital insensitivity to pain. Many people with congenital insensitivity to  pain also have a complete loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). html:p Congenital insensitivity to pain is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy  because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and  spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell,  and pain.

This condition is also known as hereditary sensory and  autonomic neuropathy type IV. The signs and symptoms of CIPA appear early,  usually at birth or during infancy, but with careful medical attention, affected  individuals can live into adulthood. html:p An inability to feel pain and temperature often leads to repeated severe  injuries. Unintentional self-injury is common in people with CIPA, typically by  biting the tongue, lips, or fingers, which may lead to spontaneous amputation of  the affected area. In addition, people with CIPA heal slowly from skin and bone  injuries. Repeated trauma can lead to chronic bone infections (osteomyelitis)  or a condition called   html:p Normally, sweating helps cool the body temperature.

This pattern of movements is present from infancy or early childhood and usually  persists throughout life, without other associated signs and symptoms.  Intelligence and lifespan are not affected. html:p People with congenital mirror movement disorder can have some difficulty with  certain activities of daily living, particularly with those requiring different  movements in each hand, such as typing on a keyboard. They may experience  discomfort or pain in the upper limbs during prolonged use of the hands. html:p The extent of the mirror movements in this disorder can vary, even within the  same family. In most cases, the involuntary movements are noticeable but less  pronounced than the corresponding voluntary movements. The extent of the  movements typically stay the same throughout the lifetime of an affected  individual. html:p Mirror movements can also occur in people who do not have congenital mirror  movement disorder. Mild mirror movements are common during the normal  development of young children and typically disappear before age 7. They can  also develop later in life in people with neurodegenerative disorders such as  Parkinson disease. Mirror movements may also be present in certain other  conditions with a wider range of signs and symptoms (syndromes).

frequency1: Congenital nephrotic syndrome affects 1 to 3 per 100,000 children worldwide. In Finland, where this condition is particularly common, congenital nephrotic syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 10,000 children.
Description1: html:p Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a kidney condition that begins in infancy and  typically leads to irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease) by  early childhood. Children with congenital nephrotic syndrome begin to have  symptoms of the condition between birth and 3 months. html:p The features of congenital nephrotic syndrome are caused by failure of the  kidneys to filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. Signs  and symptoms of this condition are excessive protein in the urine (proteinuria),  increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup  of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected  individuals may also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a  reduced number of red blood cells (anemia) in the body, abnormal blood clotting,  or reduced amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts  can lead to a weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with  congenital nephrotic syndrome. html:p Children with congenital nephrotic syndrome typically develop end-stage renal  disease between ages 2 and 8, although with treatment, some may not have kidney  failure until adolescence or early adulthood.

Name1: Congenital plasminogen deficiency
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-plasminogen-deficiency
frequency1: The prevalence of congenital plasminogen deficiency has been estimated at 1.6 per one million people. This condition is believed to be underdiagnosed, because growths in one area are often not recognized as being a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems. Mild cases likely never come to medical attention.
Description1: html:p Congenital plasminogen deficiency is a disorder that results in inflamed growths  on the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body openings  such as the eyelids and the inside of the mouth. Development of the growths are  usually triggered by infections or injury, but they may also occur spontaneously  in the absence of known triggers. The growths may recur after being removed. html:p Congenital plasminogen deficiency most often affects the conjunctiva, which are  the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye (the sclera) and  line the eyelids. A characteristic feature of this disorder is ligneous  conjunctivitis, in which a buildup of a protein called fibrin causes  inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) and leads to thick, woody  (ligneous), inflamed growths that are yellow, white, or red. Ligneous  conjunctivitis most often occurs on the inside of the eyelids. However, in about  one-third of cases, ligneous conjunctivitis over the sclera grows onto the  cornea, which is the clear covering that protects the colored part of the eye  (the iris) and pupil. Such growths can tear the cornea or cause scarring. These  corneal problems as well as obstruction by growths inside the eyelid can lead to  vision loss. html:p People with congenital plasminogen deficiency may also develop ligneous growths  on other mucous membranes, including the inside of the mouth and the gums; the  lining of the nasal cavity; and in females, the vagina. Growths on the mucous  membranes that line the gastrointestinal tract may result in ulcers. The growths  may also develop in the windpipe, which can cause life-threatening airway  obstruction, especially in children. In a small number of cases, affected  individuals are born with impaired drainage of the fluid that surrounds and  protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF), resulting  in a buildup of this fluid in the skull (occlusive hydrocephalus). It is unclear  how this feature is related to the other signs and symptoms of congenital  plasminogen deficiency.

Description1: html:p Congenital stromal corneal dystrophy is an inherited eye disorder. This  condition primarily affects the cornea, which is the clear outer covering of the  eye. In people with this condition, the cornea appears cloudy and may have an  irregular surface. These corneal changes lead to visual impairment, including  blurring, glare, and a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity). Visual  impairment is often associated with additional eye abnormalities, including  "lazy eye"(amblyopia), eyes that do not look in the same direction  (strabismus), involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and increased sensitivity  to light (photophobia).

People with this condition cannot break down  the sugars sucrose and maltose. Sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also  known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains) are called  disaccharides because they are made of two simple sugars. Disaccharides are  broken down into simple sugars during digestion.

People with congenital sucrase-isomaltase  deficiency cannot break down the sugars sucrose and maltose, and other compounds  made from these sugar molecules (carbohydrates). html:p Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency usually becomes apparent after an  infant is weaned and starts to consume fruits, juices, and grains. After  ingestion of sucrose or maltose, an affected child will typically experience  stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production, and diarrhea. These digestive  problems can lead to failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate  (failure to thrive) and malnutrition.

Name1: Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/core-binding-factor-acute-myeloid-leukemia
frequency1: Acute myeloid leukemia occurs in approximately 3.5 per 100,000 individuals each year. CBF-AML accounts for 12 to 15 percent of acute myeloid leukemia cases in adults.
Description1: html:p Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) is one form of a cancer of  the blood-forming tissue (bone marrow) called acute myeloid leukemia. In normal  bone marrow, early blood cells called hematopoietic stem cells develop into  several types of blood cells: white blood cells (leukocytes) that protect the  body from infection, red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, and blood  cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytes) that are involved in blood  clotting. In acute myeloid leukemia, the bone marrow makes large numbers of  abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. Instead of  developing into normal white blood cells, the myeloid blasts develop into  cancerous leukemia cells. The large number of abnormal cells in the bone marrow  interferes with the production of functional white blood cells, red blood cells,  and platelets. html:p People with CBF-AML have a shortage of all types of mature blood cells: a  shortage of white blood cells (leukopenia) leads to increased susceptibility to  infections, a low number of red blood cells (anemia) causes fatigue and  weakness, and a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can  result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. Other symptoms of CBF-AML may  include fever and weight loss. html:p While acute myeloid leukemia is generally a disease of older adults, CBF-AML  often begins in young adulthood and can occur in childhood. Compared to other  forms of acute myeloid leukemia, CBF-AML has a relatively good prognosis: about  90 percent of individuals with CBF-AML recover from their disease following  treatment, compared with 25 to 40 percent of those with other forms of acute  myeloid leukemia. However, the disease recurs in approximately half of them  after successful treatment of the initial occurrence.

Other signs and  symptoms of Costello syndrome can include tight Achilles tendons (which connect  the calf muscles to the heel),  (), a structural  abnormality of the brain called a Chiari I malformation, skeletal abnormalities,  dental problems, and problems with vision. html:p Beginning in early childhood, people with Costello syndrome are at an increased  risk of developing certain cancerous and noncancerous tumors. The most common  noncancerous tumors associated with this condition are papillomas, which are  small, wart-like growths that usually develop around the nose and mouth or near  the anus. The most common cancerous tumor associated with Costello syndrome is a  childhood cancer called rhabdomyosarcoma, which begins in muscle tissue.  Neuroblastoma, a tumor that arises in developing nerve cells, also has been  reported in children and adolescents with this syndrome. In addition, some  teenagers with Costello syndrome have developed transitional cell carcinoma, a  form of bladder cancer that is usually seen in older adults. html:p The signs and symptoms of Costello syndrome overlap significantly with those of  two other genetic conditions, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC syndrome) and  Noonan syndrome. In affected infants, it can be difficult to tell the three  conditions apart based on their physical features. However, the conditions can  be distinguished by their genetic cause and by specific patterns of signs and  symptoms that develop later in childhood.

frequency1: Cranioectodermal dysplasia is a rare condition with an unknown prevalence. Approximately 40 cases of this condition have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Cranioectodermal dysplasia is a disorder that affects many parts of the body.  The most common features involve    . The signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected  individuals, even among members of the same family. html:p Distinctive abnormalities of the skull and face are common in people with  cranioectodermal dysplasia. Most affected individuals have a prominent forehead  (frontal bossing) and an elongated head (dolichocephaly) due to abnormal fusion  of certain skull bones (sagittal craniosynostosis). A variety of facial  abnormalities can occur in people with this condition; these include low-set  ears that may also be rotated backward, an increased distance between the inner  corners of the eyes (telecanthus), and outside corners of the eyes that point  upward or downward (upslanting or downslanting palpebral fissures) among others. html:p is also affected in this  condition. Abnormalities in the long bones of the arms and legs (metaphyseal  dysplasia) lead to short limbs and . In addition, affected  individuals often have short fingers (brachydactyly). Some people with this  condition have short rib bones and a narrow rib cage, which can cause breathing  problems, especially in affected newborns. html:p in people with cranioectodermal  dysplasia can lead to   html:p Cranioectodermal dysplasia can affect additional organs and tissues in the body.  A kidney disorder known as nephronophthisis occurs in many people with this  condition, and it can lead to a life-threatening failure of kidney function  known as end-stage renal disease. Abnormalities of the liver, heart, or eyes  also occur in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia.

Description1: html:p Craniofacial microsomia is a term used to describe a spectrum of abnormalities  that primarily affect the  birth. Microsomia means abnormal smallness of body structures. Most people with  craniofacial microsomia have differences in the size and shape of facial  structures between the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). In  about two-thirds of cases, both sides of the face have abnormalities, which  usually differ from one side to the other. Other individuals with craniofacial  microsomia are affected on only one side of the face. The facial characteristics  in craniofacial microsomia typically include  , which can cause  dental problems and difficulties with feeding and . In cases of severe  , breathing may also be affected. html:p People with craniofacial microsomia usually have ear abnormalities affecting one  or both ears, typically to different degrees. They may have growths of skin  (skin tags) in front of the ear (preauricular tags), an underdeveloped or absent  external ear (microtia or anotia), or a closed or absent ear canal; these  abnormalities may lead to hearing loss. Eye problems are less common in  craniofacial microsomia, but some affected individuals have an unusually small  eyeball (microphthalmia) or other eye abnormalities that result in vision loss. html:p Abnormalities in other parts of the body, such as malformed bones of the spine  (vertebrae), abnormally shaped kidneys, and s, may also occur in  people with craniofacial microsomia. html:p Many other terms have been used for craniofacial microsomia. These other names  generally refer to forms of craniofacial microsomia with specific combinations  of signs and symptoms, although sometimes they are used interchangeably.  Hemifacial microsomia often refers to craniofacial microsomia with  . People with hemifacial microsomia and noncancerous  (benign) growths in the eye called epibulbar dermoids may be said to have  Goldenhar syndrome or oculoauricular dysplasia.

frequency1: Craniometaphyseal dysplasia is a very rare disorder; its incidence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Craniometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare condition characterized by progressive  thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and abnormalities at the ends of long  bones in the limbs (metaphyseal dysplasia). Except in the most severe cases,  the lifespan of people with craniometaphyseal dysplasia is normal. html:p Bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of  craniometaphyseal dysplasia. Affected individuals typically have distinctive  facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes  (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excessive new bone formation  (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent  (non-erupting) teeth. Infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding  problems caused by narrow nasal passages. In severe cases, abnormal bone growth  can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas  of the head and neck (cranial nerves). Compression of the cranial nerves can  lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness. html:p The x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped  long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. The ends of these bones  (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition. html:p There are two types of craniometaphyseal dysplasia, which are distinguished by  their pattern of inheritance. They are known as the autosomal dominant and  autosomal recessive types. Autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia is  typically more severe than the autosomal dominant form.

frequency1: Crigler-Najjar syndrome is estimated to affect fewer than 1 in 1 million newborns worldwide.
Description1: html:p Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a severe condition characterized by high levels of a  toxic substance called bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). Bilirubin is  produced when red blood cells are broken down. This substance is removed from  the body only after it undergoes a chemical reaction in the liver, which  converts the toxic form of bilirubin (called unconjugated bilirubin) to a  nontoxic form called conjugated bilirubin. People with Crigler-Najjar syndrome  have a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin in their blood (unconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia). html:p Bilirubin has an orange-yellow tint, and hyperbilirubinemia causes yellowing of  the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). In Crigler-Najjar syndrome, jaundice  is apparent at birth or in infancy. Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can  lead to a condition called kernicterus, which is a form of brain damage caused  by the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the brain and nerve tissues.  Babies with kernicterus are often extremely tired (lethargic) and may have weak  muscle tone (). These babies may experience episodes of increased  muscle tone (hypertonia) and arching of their backs. Kernicterus can lead to  other neurological problems, including involuntary writhing movements of the  body (choreoathetosis), hearing problems, or  disability. html:p Crigler-Najjar syndrome is divided into two types. Type 1 (CN1) is very severe,  and affected individuals can die in childhood due to kernicterus, although with  proper treatment, they may survive longer. Type 2 (CN2) is less severe. People  with CN2 are less likely to develop kernicterus, and most affected individuals  survive into adulthood.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a term that refers to a group of</span>  serious s that are present from birth. These abnormalities result  from problems with the formation of one or more parts of the heart during the  early stages of embryonic development. CCHD prevents the heart from pumping  blood effectively or reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. As a result,  organs and tissues throughout the body do not receive enough oxygen, which can  lead to organ damage and life-threatening complications. Individuals with CCHD  usually require surgery soon after birth. html:p Although babies with CCHD may appear healthy for the first few hours or days of  life, signs and symptoms soon become apparent. These can include an abnormal  heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur), rapid breathing (tachypnea), low  blood pressure (hypotension), low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), and  a blue or purple tint to the skin caused by a shortage of oxygen (cyanosis). If  untreated, CCHD can lead to shock, coma, and death. However, most people with  CCHD now survive past infancy due to improvements in early detection, diagnosis,  and treatment. html:p Some people with treated CCHD have few related health problems later in life.  However, long-term effects of CCHD can include and reduced  stamina during exercise. Adults with these s have an increased risk  of s, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and  premature death. html:p Each of the s associated with CCHD affects the flow of blood into,  out of, or through the heart. Some of the s involve structures  within the heart itself, such as the two lower chambers of the heart (the  ventricles) or the valves that control blood flow through the heart. Others  affect the structure of the large blood vessels leading into and out of the  heart (including the aorta and pulmonary artery). Still others involve a  combination of these structural abnormalities. html:p People with CCHD have one or more specific s. The s  classified as CCHD include coarctation of the aorta, double-outlet right  ventricle, D-transposition of the great arteries, Ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic  left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia with intact  septum, single ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy  of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Crohn disease is most common in western Europe and North America, where it</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">has a prevalence of 100 to 300 per 100,000 people. More than half a million</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Americans are currently affected by this disorder. Crohn disease occurs more</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">often in people of northern European ancestry and those of eastern and central</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent than among people of other ethnic</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">backgrounds. For reasons that are not clear, the prevalence of Crohn disease has</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">been increasing in the United States and some other parts of the world.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Crohn disease is a complex, long-lasting (chronic) disorder that primarily</span>  affects the digestive system. This condition involves an abnormal immune  response that causes excess inflammation. It most often affects the intestinal  walls, particularly in the lower part of the small intestine (the ileum) and  portions of the large intestine (the colon). However, inflammation can occur in  any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus. The inflamed  tissues become thick and swollen, and the inner surfaces of the digestive system  may develop open sores (ulcers). html:p Crohn disease most commonly appears in a person's late teens or twenties,  although the disease can begin at any age. Signs and symptoms tend to flare up  multiple times throughout life. The most common features of this condition are  persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, loss of appetite, weight loss,  and fever. Some people with Crohn disease have blood in the stool from inflamed  tissues in the intestine; over time, chronic bleeding can lead to a low number  of red blood cells (anemia). In some cases, Crohn disease can also cause  inflammation affecting the , eyes, or skin. html:p Intestinal blockage is a common complication of Crohn disease. Blockages are  caused by swelling or a buildup of scar tissue in the intestinal walls. Some  affected individuals also develop fistulae, which are abnormal connections  between the intestine and other tissues. Fistulae occur when ulcers break  through the intestinal wall and passages form between loops of the intestine or  between the intestine and nearby structures (such as the bladder, vagina, or  skin). html:p Crohn disease is one common form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Another  type of IBD, ulcerative colitis, also causes chronic inflammation of the  intestinal lining. Unlike Crohn disease, which can affect any part of the  digestive system, ulcerative colitis typically causes inflammation only in the  colon.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/crouzon-syndrome
frequency1: Crouzon syndrome is seen in about 16 per million newborns. It is the most common craniosynostosis syndrome.
Description1: html:p Crouzon syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of  certain skull bones (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull  from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. html:p Many features of Crouzon syndrome result from the premature fusion of the skull  bones. Abnormal growth of these bones leads to wide-set, bulging eyes and vision  problems caused by shallow eye sockets; eyes that do not point in the same  direction (strabismus); a beaked nose; and an underdeveloped upper jaw. In  addition, people with Crouzon syndrome may have dental problems and hearing  loss, which is sometimes accompanied by narrow ear canals. A few people with  Crouzon syndrome have an opening in the lip and the roof of the mouth (cleft lip  and palate). The severity of these signs and symptoms varies among affected  people. People with Crouzon syndrome are usually of normal intelligence.

frequency1: Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans is rare; this condition occurs in about 1 person per million. For unknown reasons, it affects females more than twice as often as males.
Description1: html:p Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans is a disorder characterized by the  premature joining of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis) during  development and a skin condition called acanthosis nigricans. html:p The signs and symptoms of Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans overlap  with those of a similar condition called Crouzon syndrome. Both conditions  involve premature fusion of the skull bones, which affects the shape of the head  and face. Other common features of both conditions include wide-set, bulging  eyes due to shallow eye sockets; eyes that do not point in the same direction  (strabismus); a small, beaked nose;  . Less common features that can occur in  either disorder include an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate),  dental problems, or hearing loss. People with Crouzon syndrome or Crouzon  syndrome with acanthosis nigricans usually have normal intelligence. html:p Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans is distinguished from Crouzon  syndrome by several features, including skin abnormalities. Acanthosis nigricans  is a skin condition characterized by thick, dark, velvety skin in body folds  and creases, including the neck and underarms. People with Crouzon syndrome with  acanthosis nigricans may also have other skin abnormalities; for example, scars  in the thick, dark areas of skin are flat and pale. These scars are usually  from surgical procedures that are commonly needed in affected individuals.  Additionally, in some people with the condition, one or both nasal passages are  narrowed (choanal stenosis) or completely blocked (choanal atresia), which can  cause difficulty breathing. A buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) can  also occur. Nasal passage abnormalities and hydrocephalus are rare in Crouzon  syndrome. Less common features of Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans  include subtle changes in the bones of the spine (vertebrae), abnormalities of  the finger bones, and noncancerous growths in the jaw called cementomas.

Description1: html:p Cushing disease is caused by elevated levels of a hormone called cortisol, which  leads to a wide variety of signs and symptoms. This condition usually occurs in  adults between the ages of 20 and 50; however, children may also be affected.  The first sign of this condition is usually weight gain around the trunk and in  the face. Affected individuals may get stretch marks (striae) on their thighs  and abdomen and bruise easily. Individuals with Cushing disease can develop a  hump on their upper back caused by abnormal deposits of fat. People with this  condition can have muscle weakness, severe tiredness, and progressively thin and  brittle bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis). They also have a  weakened immune system and are at an increased risk of infections. Cushing  disease can cause mood disorders such as , irritability, and .  This condition can also affect a person's concentration and memory. People with  Cushing disease have an increased chance of developing high blood pressure  (hypertension) and diabetes.

Description1: html:p Cutis laxa is a disorder of connective tissue, which is the tissue that forms  the body's supportive framework. Connective tissue provides structure and  strength to the muscles, joints, organs, and skin. html:p The term"cutis laxa"is Latin for loose or lax skin, and this condition is  characterized by skin that is sagging and not stretchy (inelastic). The skin  often hangs in loose folds, causing the face and other parts of the body to have  a droopy appearance. Extremely wrinkled skin may be particularly noticeable on  the neck and in the armpits and groin. html:p Cutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body,  including the heart, blood vessels, joints, intestines, and lungs. The disorder  can cause heart problems and abnormal narrowing, bulging, or tearing of critical  arteries. Affected individuals may have soft out-pouchings in the lower abdomen  (inguinal hernia) or around the belly button (umbilical hernia). Pouches called  diverticula can also develop in the walls of certain organs, such as the  bladder and intestines. During childhood, some people with cutis laxa develop a  lung disease called emphysema, which can make it difficult to breathe. Depending  on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa  can range from mild to life-threatening. html:p Researchers have described several different forms of cutis laxa. The forms are  often distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant,  autosomal recessive, or X-linked. In general, the autosomal recessive forms of  cutis laxa tend to be more severe than the autosomal dominant forms. In addition  to the features described above, some people with autosomal recessive cutis  laxa have  , and problems  with movement that can worsen over time. html:p The X-linked form of cutis laxa is often called occipital horn syndrome. This  form of the disorder is considered a mild type of Menkes syndrome, which is a  condition that affects copper levels in the body. In addition to sagging and  inelastic skin, occipital horn syndrome is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium  deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair,  and

Description1: html:p Cyclic neutropenia is a disorder that causes frequent infections and other  health problems in affected individuals. People with this condition have  recurrent episodes of neutropenia during which there is a shortage (deficiency)  of neutrophils. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in  inflammation and in fighting infection. The episodes of neutropenia are apparent  at birth or soon afterward. For most affected individuals, neutropenia recurs  every 21 days and lasts about 3 to 5 days. html:p Neutropenia makes it more difficult for the body to fight off pathogens such as  bacteria and viruses, so people with cyclic neutropenia typically develop  recurrent infections of the sinuses, respiratory tract, and skin. Additionally,  people with this condition often develop open sores (ulcers) in the mouth and  colon, inflammation of the throat (pharyngitis) and gums (gingivitis), recurrent  fever, or abdominal pain. People with cyclic neutropenia have these health  problems only during episodes of neutropenia. At times when their neutrophil  levels are normal, they are not at an increased risk of infection and  inflammation.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a disorder that causes recurrent episodes of nausea,</span>  vomiting, and tiredness (lethargy). This condition is diagnosed most often in  young children, but it can affect people of any age. html:p The episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy last anywhere from an hour to 10  days. An affected person may vomit several times per hour, potentially leading  to a dangerous loss of fluids (dehydration). Additional symptoms can include  unusually pale skin (pallor), abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, and an  increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) or to sound (phonophobia). In most  affected people, the signs and symptoms of each attack are quite similar. These  attacks can be debilitating, making it difficult for an affected person to go to  work or school. html:p Episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy can occur regularly or apparently at  random, or can be triggered by a variety of factors. The most common triggers  are emotional excitement and infections. Other triggers can include periods  without eating (fasting), temperature extremes, lack of sleep, overexertion,  allergies, ingesting certain foods or alcohol, and menstruation. html:p If the condition is not treated, episodes usually occur four to 12 times per  year. Between attacks, vomiting is absent, and nausea is either absent or much  reduced. However, many affected people experience other symptoms during and  between episodes, including pain, lethargy, digestive disorders such as  gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, and fainting spells  (syncope). People with cyclic vomiting syndrome are also more likely than people  without the disorder to experience , , and panic disorder. It  is unclear whether these health conditions are directly related to nausea and  vomiting. html:p Cyclic vomiting syndrome is often considered to be a variant of migraines, which  are severe headaches often associated with pain, nausea, vomiting, and extreme  sensitivity to light and sound. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is likely the same as  or closely related to a condition called abdominal migraine, which is  characterized by attacks of stomach pain and cramping. Attacks of nausea,  vomiting, or abdominal pain in childhood may be replaced by migraine headaches  as an affected person gets older. Many people with cyclic vomiting syndrome or  abdominal migraine have a family history of migraines. html:p Most people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have normal intelligence, although  some affected people have . Autism  spectrum disorders, which affect  and  interaction, have  also been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Additionally, muscle  weakness (myopathy) and  are possible.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by the buildup of thick,</span>  sticky mucus that can damage many of the body's organs. The disorder's most  common signs and symptoms include progressive damage to the respiratory system  and chronic digestive system problems. The features of the disorder and their  severity varies among affected individuals. html:p Mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the linings of the  airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues.  In people with cystic fibrosis, the body produces mucus that is abnormally thick  and sticky. This abnormal mucus can clog the airways, leading to severe  problems with breathing and bacterial infections in the lungs. These infections  cause chronic coughing, wheezing, and inflammation. Over time, mucus buildup and  infections result in permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar  tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs. html:p Most people with cystic fibrosis also have digestive problems. Some affected  babies have meconium ileus, a blockage of the intestine that occurs shortly  after birth. Other digestive problems result from a buildup of thick, sticky  mucus in the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that produces insulin (a hormone  that helps control blood sugar levels). It also makes enzymes that help digest  food. In people with cystic fibrosis, mucus blocks the ducts of the pancreas,  reducing the production of insulin and preventing digestive enzymes from  reaching the intestines to aid digestion. Problems with digestion can lead to  diarrhea, malnutrition, , and weight loss. In adolescence or  adulthood, a shortage of insulin can cause a form of diabetes known as cystic  fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus (CFRDM). html:p Cystic fibrosis used to be considered a fatal disease of childhood. With  improved treatments and better ways to manage the disease, many people with  cystic fibrosis now live well into adulthood. Adults with cystic fibrosis  experience health problems affecting the respiratory, digestive, and  reproductive systems. Most men with cystic fibrosis have congenital bilateral  absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a condition in which the tubes that carry  sperm (the vas deferens) are blocked by mucus and do not develop properly. Men  with CBAVD are unable to father children (infertile) unless they undergo  fertility treatment. Women with cystic fibrosis may experience complications in  pregnancy.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cystinosis
frequency1: Cystinosis affects approximately 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns <span style="background:#FFFF00;">worldwide. The incidence is higher in the province of Brittany, France, where</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">the disorder affects 1 in 26,000 individuals.</span>
Description1: html:p Cystinosis is a condition characterized by accumulation of the amino acid  cystine (a building block of proteins) within cells. Excess cystine damages  cells and often forms crystals that can build up and cause problems in many  organs and tissues. The kidneys and eyes are especially vulnerable to damage;  the muscles, thyroid, pancreas, and testes may also be affected. html:p There are three distinct types of cystinosis. In order of decreasing severity,  they are nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic  or ocular cystinosis. html:p Nephropathic cystinosis begins in infancy, causing  and a particular  type of kidney damage (renal Fanconi syndrome) in which certain molecules that  should be reabsorbed into the bloodstream are instead eliminated in the urine.  The kidney problems lead to the loss of important minerals, salts, fluids, and  many other nutrients. The loss of nutrients and may result in  soft, bowed bones (hypophosphatemic rickets), especially in the legs. The  nutrient imbalances in the body lead to increased urination, thirst,  dehydration, and abnormally acidic blood (acidosis). By about the age of 2,  cystine crystals may be present in the clear covering of the eye (cornea). The  buildup of these crystals in the eye causes pain and an increased sensitivity to  light (photophobia). Untreated children will experience complete kidney  failure by about the age of 10. Other signs and symptoms that may occur in  untreated people, especially after adolescence, include muscle deterioration,  blindness, inability to swallow, diabetes, thyroid and nervous system problems,  and an inability to father children (infertility) in affected men. html:p The signs and symptoms of intermediate cystinosis are the same as nephropathic  cystinosis, but they occur at a later age. Intermediate cystinosis typically  becomes apparent in affected individuals in adolescence. Malfunctioning kidneys  and corneal crystals are the main initial features of this disorder. If  intermediate cystinosis is left untreated, complete kidney failure will occur,  but usually not until the late teens to mid-twenties. html:p People with non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis typically experience  photophobia due to cystine crystals in the cornea, but usually do not develop  kidney malfunction or most of the other signs and symptoms of cystinosis. Due to  the absence of severe symptoms, the age at which this form of cystinosis is  diagnosed varies widely.

Description1: html:p Cystinuria is a condition characterized by the buildup of the amino acid  cystine, a building block of most proteins, in the kidneys and bladder. As the  kidneys filter blood to create urine, cystine is normally absorbed back into the  bloodstream. People with cystinuria cannot properly reabsorb cystine into  their bloodstream, so the amino acid accumulates in their urine. html:p As urine becomes more concentrated in the kidneys, the excess cystine forms  crystals. Larger crystals become stones that may lodge in the kidneys or in the  bladder. Sometimes cystine crystals combine with calcium molecules in the  kidneys to form large stones. These crystals and stones can create blockages in  the urinary tract and reduce the ability of the kidneys to eliminate waste  through urine. The stones also provide sites where bacteria may cause  infections.

frequency1: The prevalence of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is unknown. About 65 cases have been reported worldwide.Researchers suspect that cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is underdiagnosed and that mild cases of this disorder may be relatively common. Because the signs and symptoms can be difficult to detect, people with mild cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency may never come to medical attention.
Description1: html:p Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is a disorder of hormone production.  This condition specifically affects steroid hormones, which are needed for  normal development and reproduction. The hormonal changes associated with  cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency can affect the development of the  reproductive system, skeleton, and other parts of the body. These signs and  symptoms are usually present at birth or become apparent in early childhood. html:p The signs and symptoms of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency vary from  mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of mild cases can include a failure to begin  menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea), an inability to have biological  children (infertility) in both men and women, and a condition called polycystic  ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by a hormonal imbalance in women  that can lead to irregular menstruation, acne, excess body hair (hirsutism), and  weight gain. html:p People with moderate cases of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency may have    , and they may have infertility. People with moderate cytochrome P450  oxidoreductase deficiency usually do not have skeletal abnormalities. html:p The severe form of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is sometimes called  Antley-Bixler syndrome with genital anomalies and disordered steroidogenesis.  Hormonal changes in affected males and females lead to the development of  or other , as well as infertility.  Severe cases are also characterized by skeletal abnormalities, particularly  involving bones of the head and face. These include premature fusion of the  skull bones (craniosynostosis), a flattened mid-face, a prominent forehead, and  low-set ears. Other skeletal abnormalities can include  that limit movement; unusually long, slender fingers  (arachnodactyly); bowing of the thigh bones; and radiohumeral synostosis, which  is a bone abnormality that locks the elbows in a bent position. A blockage of  the nasal passages (choanal atresia),  are also associated with the severe form of the disorder. html:p Some women who are pregnant with fetuses affected by cytochrome P450  oxidoreductase deficiency experience mild symptoms of the disorder even though  they themselves do not have the disorder. They may develop excessive body hair  growth (hirsutism), acne, and a deep voice. These changes go away soon after  delivery.

frequency1: Acute myeloid leukemia occurs in approximately 3.5 per 100,000 individuals each year. Forty to 50 percent of people with acute myeloid leukemia have CN-AML.
Description1: html:p Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is one form of a cancer  of the blood-forming tissue (bone marrow) called acute myeloid leukemia. In  normal bone marrow, early blood cells called hematopoietic stem cells develop  into several types of blood cells: white blood cells (leukocytes) that protect  the body from infection, red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, and  cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytes) that are involved in blood  clotting. In acute myeloid leukemia, the bone marrow makes large numbers of  abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. Instead of  developing into normal white blood cells, the myeloid blasts develop into  cancerous leukemia cells. The large number of abnormal cells in the bone marrow  interferes with the production of functional white blood cells, red blood cells,  and platelets. html:p People with CN-AML have a shortage of all types of mature blood cells: a  shortage of white blood cells (leukopenia) leads to increased susceptibility to  infections, a low number of red blood cells (anemia) causes fatigue and  weakness, and a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can  result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. Other symptoms of CN-AML may  include fever and weight loss. html:p The age at which CN-AML begins ranges from childhood to late adulthood. CN-AML  is said to be an intermediate-risk cancer because the prognosis varies: some  affected individuals respond well to normal treatment while others may require  stronger treatments. The age at which the condition begins and the prognosis are  affected by the specific genetic factors involved in the condition.

Description1: html:p Danon disease is a condition characterized by weakening of the heart muscle  (cardiomyopathy); weakening of the muscles used for movement, called skeletal  muscles, (myopathy); and  disability. Males with Danon disease  usually develop the condition earlier than females and are more severely  affected. Signs and symptoms begin in childhood or adolescence in most affected  males and in early adulthood in most affected females. Affected males, on  average, live to age 19, while affected females live to an average age of 34. html:p Cardiomyopathy is the most common symptom of Danon disease and occurs in all  males with the condition. Most affected men have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,  which is a thickening of the heart muscle that may make it harder for the heart  to pump blood. Other affected males have dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a  condition that weakens and enlarges the heart, preventing it from pumping blood  efficiently. Some affected men with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy later develop  dilated cardiomyopathy. Either type of cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure  and premature death. Most women with Danon disease also develop cardiomyopathy;  of the women who have this feature, about half have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,  and the other half have dilated cardiomyopathy. html:p Affected individuals can have other heart-related signs and symptoms, including  a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), an abnormal  heartbeat (arrhythmia), or chest pain. Many affected individuals have  abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (conduction  abnormalities). People with Danon disease are often affected by a specific  conduction abnormality known as cardiac preexcitation. The type of cardiac  preexcitation most often seen in people with Danon disease is called the  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome pattern. html:p Skeletal myopathy occurs in most men with Danon disease and about half of  affected women. The weakness typically occurs in the muscles of the upper arms,  shoulders, neck, and upper thighs. Many males with Danon disease have elevated  levels of an enzyme called creatine kinase in their blood, which often indicates  muscle disease. html:p Most men with Danon disease, but only a small percentage of affected women, have  disability. If present, the disability is usually mild. html:p There can be other signs and symptoms of the condition in addition to the three  characteristic features. Several affected individuals have had gastrointestinal  disease, breathing problems, or visual abnormalities.

Description1: html:p Darier disease is a skin condition characterized by wart-like blemishes on the  body. The blemishes are usually yellowish in color, hard to the touch, mildly  greasy, and can emit a strong odor. The most common sites for blemishes are the  scalp, forehead, upper arms, chest, back, knees, elbows, and behind the ear.  The mucous membranes can also be affected, with blemishes on the roof of the  mouth (palate), tongue, inside of the cheek, gums, and throat. Other features  of Darier disease include nail abnormalities, such as red and white streaks in  the nails with an irregular texture, and small pits in the palms of the hands  and soles of the feet. html:p The wart-like blemishes characteristic of Darier disease usually appear in late  childhood to early adulthood. The severity of the disease varies over time;  affected people experience flare-ups alternating with periods when they have  fewer blemishes. The appearance of the blemishes is influenced by environmental  factors. Most people with Darier disease will develop more blemishes during  the summertime when they are exposed to heat and humidity. UV light; minor  injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching; and ingestion of certain  medications can also cause an increase in blemishes. html:p On occasion, people with Darier disease may have neurological disorders such as  mild  disability, , and .  and behavior  difficulties have also been reported in people with Darier disease. Researchers  do not know if these conditions, which are common in the general population,  are associated with the genetic changes that cause Darier disease, or if they  are coincidental. Some researchers believe that  problems might be  linked to the  stigma experienced by people with numerous skin blemishes. html:p A form of Darier disease known as the linear or segmental form is characterized  by blemishes on localized areas of the skin. The blemishes are not as  widespread as they are in typical Darier disease. Some people with the linear  form of this condition have the nail abnormalities that are seen in people with  classic Darier disease, but these abnormalities occur only on one side of the  body.

Description1: html:p Deafness and myopia syndrome is a disorder that causes problems with both  hearing and vision. People with this disorder have moderate to profound hearing  loss in both ears that may worsen over time. The hearing loss may be described  as sensorineural, meaning that it is related to changes in the inner ear, or it  may be caused by auditory neuropathy, which is a problem with the transmission  of sound (auditory) signals from the inner ear to the brain. The hearing loss is  either present at birth (congenital) or begins in infancy, before the child  learns to speak (prelingual). html:p Affected individuals also have severe nearsightedness (high myopia). These  individuals are able to see nearby objects clearly, but objects that are farther  away appear blurry. The myopia is usually diagnosed by early childhood.

Name1: Dent disease
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/dent-disease
frequency1: Dent disease is a rare condition, with about 250 affected families reported. Dent disease 1 is more common than Dent disease 2.Dent disease is likely underdiagnosed because it may not be identified in people with mild signs and symptoms, and because its features overlap with those of other kidney disorders.
Description1: html:p Dent disease is a chronic kidney disorder that occurs almost exclusively in  males. In affected individuals, kidney problems result from damage to structures  called proximal tubules. Signs and symptoms of this condition appear in early  childhood and worsen over time. html:p The most frequent sign of Dent disease is the presence of an abnormally large  amount of proteins in the urine (tubular proteinuria). Other common signs of the  disorder include excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits  in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Kidney  stones can cause abdominal pain and blood in the urine (hematuria). In most  affected males, progressive kidney problems lead to end-stage renal disease  (ESRD) in early to mid-adulthood. ESRD is a life-threatening failure of kidney  function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and  waste products from the body effectively. html:p Some people with Dent disease develop rickets, a bone disorder that results when  the levels of vitamin D and certain minerals (including calcium) in the blood  become too low. Rickets can be associated with weakening and softening of the  bones, bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. html:p Researchers have described two forms of Dent disease, which are distinguished by  their genetic cause and pattern of signs and symptoms. Both forms of Dent  disease (type 1 and type 2) are characterized by the features described above,  but Dent disease 2 can also be associated with abnormalities unrelated to kidney  function. These additional signs and symptoms include mild  disability,  (), and clouding of the lens of the eyes  (cataract) that is described as subclinical because it does not impair vision.  Some researchers consider Dent disease 2 to be a mild variant of a similar  disorder called Lowe syndrome.

Teeth are also weaker than normal, making them prone to rapid  wear, breakage, and loss. These problems can affect both primary (baby) teeth  and permanent teeth. html:p Researchers have described three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta with similar  dental abnormalities. Type I occurs in people who have osteogenesis imperfecta,  a genetic condition in which bones are brittle and easily broken.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and type III usually occur in people without  other inherited disorders. A few older individuals with type II have had  progressive high-frequency hearing loss in addition to dental abnormalities, but  it is not known whether this hearing loss is related to dentinogenesis  imperfecta. html:p Some researchers believe that dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and type III,  along with a condition called dentin dysplasia type II, are actually forms of a  single disorder. The signs and symptoms of dentin dysplasia type II are very  similar to those of dentinogenesis imperfecta.

Description1: html:p Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare type of cancer that causes a tumor in  the deep layers of skin. This condition is a type of soft tissue sarcoma, which  are cancers that affect skin, fat, muscle, and similar tissues. html:p In dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, the tumor most often starts as a small, firm  patch of skin, usually 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter, that is usually  purplish, reddish, or flesh-colored. The tumor typically grows slowly and can  become a raised nodule. Occasionally, the tumor begins as a flat or depressed  patch of skin (plaque). Tumors are most commonly found on the torso and can also  be found on the arms, legs, head, or neck. Affected individuals usually first  show signs of this condition in their thirties, but the age at which a tumor  appears varies widely. html:p In dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, the tumor has a tendency to return after  being removed. However, it does not often spread to other parts of the body  (metastasize). html:p There are several variants of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in which different  cell types are involved in the tumor. Bednar tumors, often called pigmented  dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, contain dark-colored (pigmented) cells called  melanin-containing dendritic cells. Myxoid dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans  tumors contain an abnormal type of connective tissue known as myxoid stroma.  Giant cell fibroblastoma, which is sometimes referred to as juvenile  dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans because it typically affects children and  adolescents, is characterized by giant cells in the tumor. html:p Rarely, the tumors involved in the different types of dermatofibrosarcoma  protuberans can have regions that look similar to fibrosarcoma, a more  type of soft tissue sarcoma. In these cases, the condition is called  fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans or FS-DFSP. FS-DFSP tumors are  more likely to metastasize than tumors in the other types of dermatofibrosarcoma  protuberans.

Typically, a single tumor develops, although some  people have multiple tumors. The tumors can occur anywhere in the body. Tumors  that form in the abdominal wall are called abdominal desmoid tumors; those that  arise from the tissue that connects the abdominal organs are called  intra-abdominal desmoid tumors; and tumors found in other regions of the body  are called extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Extra-abdominal tumors occur most  often in the shoulders, upper arms, and upper legs. html:p Desmoid tumors are fibrous, much like scar tissue. They are generally not  considered cancerous (malignant) because they do not spread to other parts of  the body (metastasize); however, they can ly invade the surrounding  tissue and can be very difficult to remove surgically. These tumors often recur,  even after apparently complete removal. html:p The most common symptom of desmoid tumors is pain. Other signs and symptoms,  which are often caused by growth of the tumor into surrounding tissue, vary  based on the size and location of the tumor. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors can  block the bowel, causing constipation. Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors can  and cause limping or difficulty moving  the arms or legs. html:p Desmoid tumors occur frequently in people with an inherited form of colon cancer  called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). These individuals typically  develop intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in addition to abnormal growths (called  polyps) and cancerous tumors in the colon. Desmoid tumors that are not part of  an inherited condition are described as sporadic.

frequency1: Diamond-Blackfan anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 per million liveborn infants worldwide.
Description1: html:p Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a disorder of the bone marrow. The major function of  bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. In Diamond-Blackfan anemia, the bone  marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen  to the body's tissues. The resulting shortage of red blood cells (anemia)  usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Symptoms of anemia  include fatigue, weakness, and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor). html:p People with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have an increased risk of several serious  complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they  have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),  which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally.  Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing certain cancers,  including a cancer of blood-forming tissue known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  and a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma. html:p Approximately half of individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have physical  abnormalities. They may have an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and a  low frontal hairline, along with distinctive facial features such as wide-set  eyes (hypertelorism); droopy eyelids (ptosis); a broad, flat bridge of the nose;  small, low-set ears; and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Affected individuals  may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or  without a split in the upper lip (cleft lip). They may have a short, webbed  neck; shoulder blades which are smaller and higher than usual; and abnormalities  of their hands, most commonly malformed or absent thumbs. About one-third of  affected individuals have leading to . html:p Other features of Diamond-Blackfan anemia may include eye problems such as  clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), increased pressure in the eyes  (glaucoma), or eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).  Affected individuals may also have kidney abnormalities; structural defects of  the heart; and, in males, the   html:p The severity of Diamond-Blackfan anemia may vary, even within the same family.  Increasingly, individuals with"non-classical"Diamond-Blackfan anemia have been  identified. This form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms that  may include mild anemia beginning in adulthood.

Description1: html:p Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency is a severe condition that can affect  several body systems. Signs and symptoms of this condition usually appear  shortly after birth, and they can vary widely among affected individuals. html:p A common feature of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency is a potentially  life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in tissues (lactic acidosis), which can  cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat.  Neurological problems are also common in this condition; the first symptoms in  affected infants are often decreased muscle tone () and extreme  tiredness (lethargy). As the problems worsen, affected infants can have  difficulty feeding, decreased alertness, and . Liver problems can also  occur in dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, ranging from an enlarged  liver (hepatomegaly) to life-threatening liver failure. In some affected people,  liver disease, which can begin anytime from infancy to adulthood, is the  primary symptom. The liver problems are usually associated with recurrent  vomiting and abdominal pain. Rarely, people with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase  deficiency experience weakness of the muscles used for movement (skeletal  muscles), particularly during exercise; droopy eyelids; or a weakened heart  muscle (cardiomyopathy). Other features of this condition include excess ammonia  in the blood (hyperammonemia), a buildup of molecules called ketones in the  body (ketoacidosis), or low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). html:p Typically, the signs and symptoms of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency  occur in episodes that may be triggered by fever, injury, or other stresses on  the body.

Description1: html:p Dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (DCMA) syndrome is an inherited condition  characterized by heart problems, movement difficulties, and other features  affecting multiple body systems. html:p Beginning in infancy to early childhood, most people with DCMA syndrome develop  dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that weakens and enlarges the  heart, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. Some affected individuals  also have long QT syndrome, which is a heart condition that causes the cardiac  muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. The irregular  heartbeats (arrhythmia) can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest and  sudden death. Rarely, heart problems improve over time; however, in most cases  of DCMA syndrome, affected individuals do not survive past childhood due to  heart failure. A small percentage of people with DCMA syndrome have no heart  problems at all. html:p By age 2, children with DCMA syndrome have problems with  . These movement problems can result in delay of motor skills  such as standing and walking, but most older children with DCMA syndrome can  walk without support. html:p In addition to heart problems and movement difficulties, most individuals with  DCMA syndrome grow slowly before and after birth, which leads to .  Additionally, many affected individuals have mild  disability. Many  males with DCMA syndrome have  such as undescended testes  (cryptorchidism) or the  . Other common features of DCMA syndrome include unusually small  red blood cells (microcytic anemia), which can cause pale skin; an abnormal  buildup of fats in the liver (hepatic steatosis), which can damage the liver;  and the degeneration of nerve cells that carry visual information from the eyes  to the brain (optic nerve atrophy), which can lead to vision loss. html:p DCMA syndrome is associated with increased levels of a substance called  3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine. The amount of acid does not appear to  influence the signs and symptoms of the condition. DCMA syndrome is one of a  group of metabolic disorders that can be diagnosed by the presence of increased  levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria).

Description1: html:p Distal 18q deletion syndrome is a chromosomal condition that occurs when a piece  of the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 is missing. The term"distal"means that  the missing piece occurs near one end of the chromosome. Distal 18q deletion  syndrome can lead to a wide variety of signs and symptoms among affected  individuals. html:p Some common features of distal 18q deletion syndrome include  (often due to growth hormone deficiency),  (), hearing  loss, and foot abnormalities such as an inward or upward-turning foot (clubfoot)  or feet with soles that are rounded outward (rocker-bottom feet). Eye movement  disorders and other vision problems, an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft  palate), an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), heart abnormalities that  are present from birth (congenital s), kidney problems, genital  abnormalities, and skin problems may also occur in this disorder. Some affected  individuals have mild facial differences such as deep-set eyes,  , a wide mouth, and  prominent ears. These features are often not noticeable except in a detailed  medical evaluation. html:p Distal 18q deletion syndrome can also affect the nervous system. A common  neurological feature of this disorder is impaired myelin production  (dysmyelination). Myelin is a fatty substance that insulates nerve cells and  promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. The formation of a protective  myelin sheath around nerve cells (myelination) normally begins before birth and  continues into adulthood. In people with distal 18q deletion syndrome, myelin  production is often delayed and proceeds more slowly than normal; affected  individuals may never have normal adult myelin levels. Most people with distal  18q deletion syndrome have neurological problems, although it is unclear to what  extent these problems are related to the dysmyelination. These problems include    . ; ; mood disorders such as  , irritability, and ; and features of s  that affect  and  interaction may also occur. Some affected  individuals have an unusually small head size (microcephaly).

frequency1: Distal arthrogryposis type 1 affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.
Description1: html:p Distal arthrogryposis type 1 is a disorder characterized by  () that restrict movement in the hands and feet. The term  "arthrogryposis"comes from the Greek words for joint (arthro-) and crooked or  hooked (gryposis). The characteristic features of this condition include  permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), overlapping fingers, and a  hand deformity in which all of the fingers are angled outward toward the fifth  finger (ulnar deviation). Clubfoot, which is an inward- and upward-turning foot,  is also commonly seen with distal arthrogryposis type 1. The specific hand and  foot abnormalities vary among affected individuals. However, this condition  typically does not cause any signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the  body.

Description1: html:p Distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type II is a progressive disorder that  affects nerve cells in the spinal cord. It results in muscle weakness and  affects movement, primarily in the legs. html:p Onset of distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type II ranges from the teenage  years through mid-adulthood. The initial symptoms of the disorder are cramps or  weakness in the muscles of the big toe and later, the entire foot. Over a period  of approximately 5 to 10 years, affected individuals experience a gradual loss  of muscle tissue (atrophy) in the lower legs. They begin to have trouble walking  and running, and eventually may have complete paralysis of the lower legs. The  thigh muscles may also be affected, although generally this occurs later and is  less severe. html:p Some individuals with distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type II have weakening  of the muscles in the hands and forearms. This weakening is less pronounced  than in the lower limbs and does not usually result in paralysis.

Description1: html:p Distal myopathy 2 is a condition characterized by weakness of specific muscles  that begins in adulthood. It is a form of muscular dystrophy that specifically  involves muscles in the throat, lower legs, and forearms. Muscles farther from  the center of the body, like the muscles of the lower legs and forearms, are  known as distal muscles. html:p Muscle weakness in the ankles is usually the first symptom of distal myopathy 2.  The weakness can also affect muscles in the hands, wrists, and shoulders. At  first, the muscle weakness may be on only one side of the body, but both sides  are eventually involved. This muscle weakness can slowly worsen and make actions  like walking and lifting the fingers difficult. html:p Another characteristic feature of distal myopathy 2 is weakness of the vocal  cords and throat. This weakness initially causes the voice to sound weak or  breathy (hypophonic). Eventually, the voice becomes gurgling, hoarse, and nasal.  The weakness can also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).

Description1: html:p Donnai-Barrow syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects many parts of the  body. This disorder is characterized by unusual facial features, including  prominent, wide-set eyes with outer corners that point downward; a short bulbous  nose with a flat nasal bridge; ears that are rotated backward; and a widow's  peak hairline. html:p Individuals with Donnai-Barrow syndrome have severe hearing loss caused by  abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). In addition, they  often experience vision problems, including extreme nearsightedness (high  myopia), detachment or deterioration of the light-sensitive tissue in the back  of the eye (the retina), and progressive vision loss. Some have a gap or split  in the colored part of the eye (iris coloboma). html:p In almost all people with Donnai-Barrow syndrome, the tissue connecting the left  and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum) is underdeveloped or absent.  Affected individuals may also have other structural abnormalities of the brain.  They generally have mild to moderate   html:p People with Donnai-Barrow syndrome may also have a hole in the muscle that  separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm), which is called a  congenital diaphragmatic hernia. This potentially serious birth defect allows  the stomach and intestines to move into the chest and possibly crowd the  developing heart and lungs. An opening in the wall of the abdomen (an  omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the navel may  also occur in affected individuals. Occasionally people with Donnai-Barrow  syndrome have abnormalities of the intestine, heart, or other organs.

frequency1: Donohue syndrome is estimated to affect less than 1 per million people worldwide. Several dozen cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Donohue syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe insulin resistance,  a condition in which the body's tissues and organs do not respond properly to  the hormone insulin. Insulin normally helps regulate blood sugar levels by  controlling how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the  bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. Severe insulin resistance leads to  and affects the development and  function of organs and tissues throughout the body. html:p Severe insulin resistance underlies the varied signs and symptoms of Donohue  syndrome. Individuals with Donohue syndrome are unusually small starting before  birth, and affected infants experience failure to thrive, which means they do  not grow and gain weight at the expected rate. Additional features that become  apparent soon after birth include a lack of fatty tissue under the skin  (subcutaneous fat); wasting (atrophy) of muscles; excessive body hair growth  (hirsutism); multiple cysts on the ovaries in females; and enlargement of the  nipples, genitalia, kidneys, heart, and other organs. Most affected individuals  also have a skin condition called acanthosis nigricans, in which the skin in  body folds and creases becomes thick, dark, and velvety. Distinctive facial  features in people with Donohue syndrome include bulging eyes, thick lips,  upturned nostrils, and low-set ears. Affected individuals develop recurrent,  life-threatening infections beginning in infancy. html:p Donohue syndrome is one of a group of related conditions described as inherited  severe insulin resistance syndromes. These disorders, which also include  Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and type A insulin resistance syndrome, are  considered part of a spectrum. Donohue syndrome represents the most severe end  of the spectrum; most children with this condition do not survive beyond age 2.

Impaired growth of the bones at the tips of the fingers and toes (hypoplastic  terminal phalanges) account for the short fingers and toes characteristic of  this disorder. Some affected individuals also have an extra bone and joint in  their thumbs, causing the thumbs to look more like the other fingers  (triphalangeal thumbs). html:p The  that occur in people with DOORS syndrome usually start in infancy.

In  some affected individuals the  increase in frequency and become more  severe and difficult to control, and a potentially life-threatening prolonged  seizure (status epilepticus) can occur. html:p Other features that can occur in people with DOORS syndrome include an unusually  small head size (microcephaly) and facial differences, most commonly a wide,  bulbous nose. A narrow or high arched roof of the mouth (palate), broadening of  the ridges in the upper and lower jaw that contain the sockets of the teeth  (alveolar ridges), or shortening of the membrane between the floor of the mouth  and the tongue (frenulum) have also been observed in some affected individuals.  People with DOORS syndrome may also have dental abnormalities, structural  abnormalities of the heart or urinary tract, and abnormally low levels of  thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). Most affected individuals also have  higher-than-normal levels of a substance called 2-oxoglutaric acid in their  urine; these levels can fluctuate between normal and elevated.

New areas of hyperpigmentation tend  to develop over time, and the other skin lesions tend to increase in number as  well. While the skin changes associated with Dowling-Degos disease may cause  distress or , they typically cause no other health problems. html:p A condition called Galli-Galli disease has signs and symptoms similar to those  of Dowling-Degos disease. In addition to pigmentation changes, individuals with  Galli-Galli disease also have a breakdown of cells in the outer layer of skin  (acantholysis). Acantholysis can cause skin irritation and itchiness and lead to  reddened or missing patches of skin (erosions). These conditions used to be  considered two separate disorders, but Galli-Galli disease and Dowling-Degos  disease are now regarded as the same condition.

Name1: Duane-radial ray syndrome
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/duane-radial-ray-syndrome
frequency1: Duane-radial ray syndrome is a rare condition whose prevalence is unknown. Only a few affected families have been reported worldwide.
Description1: html:p Duane-radial ray syndrome is a disorder that affects the eyes and causes  abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands. This condition is characterized by  a particular problem with eye movement called Duane anomaly (also known as  Duane syndrome). This abnormality results from the improper development of  certain nerves that control eye movement. Duane anomaly limits outward eye  movement (toward the ear), and in some cases may limit inward eye movement  (toward the nose). Also, as the eye moves inward, the eye opening becomes  narrower and the eyeball may pull back (retract) into its socket. html:p Bone abnormalities in the hands include malformed or absent thumbs, an extra  thumb, or a long thumb that looks like a finger. Partial or complete absence of  bones in the forearm is also common. Together, these hand and arm abnormalities  are known as radial ray malformations. html:p People with the combination of Duane anomaly and radial ray malformations may  have a variety of other signs and symptoms. These features include unusually  shaped ears, hearing loss, heart and kidney defects, a distinctive facial  appearance, an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot), and fused spinal  bones (vertebrae). html:p The varied signs and symptoms of Duane-radial ray syndrome often overlap with  features of other disorders. For example, acro-renal-ocular syndrome is  characterized by Duane anomaly and other eye abnormalities, radial ray  malformations, and kidney defects. Both conditions are caused by mutations in  the same gene. Based on these similarities, researchers suspect that  Duane-radial ray syndrome and acro-renal-ocular syndrome are part of an  overlapping set of syndromes with many possible signs and symptoms. The features  of Duane-radial ray syndrome are also similar to those of a condition called  Holt-Oram syndrome; however, these two disorders are caused by mutations in  different genes.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic conditions characterized by</span>  progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy). The Duchenne and Becker types  of muscular dystrophy are two related conditions that primarily affect skeletal  muscles, which are used for movement, and heart (cardiac) muscle. These forms  of muscular dystrophy occur almost exclusively in males. html:p Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies have similar signs and symptoms and are  caused by different mutations in the same gene. The two conditions differ in  their severity, age of onset, and rate of progression. In boys with Duchenne  muscular dystrophy, muscle weakness tends to appear in early childhood and  worsen rapidly. Affected children may have delayed motor skills, such as  sitting, standing, and walking. They are usually wheelchair-dependent by  adolescence. The signs and symptoms of Becker muscular dystrophy are usually  milder and more varied. In most cases, muscle weakness becomes apparent later in  childhood or in adolescence and worsens at a much slower rate. html:p Both the Duchenne and Becker forms of muscular dystrophy are associated with a  heart condition called cardiomyopathy. This form of heart disease weakens the  cardiac muscle, preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. In both  Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy typically begins in  adolescence. Later, the heart muscle becomes enlarged, and the heart problems  develop into a condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy. Signs and symptoms of  dilated cardiomyopathy can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia),  shortness of breath, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and swelling of the legs and  feet. These heart problems worsen rapidly and become life-threatening in most  cases. Males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically live into their  twenties, while males with Becker muscular dystrophy can survive into their  forties or beyond. html:p A related condition called X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy is a form of heart  disease caused by mutations in the same gene as Duchenne and Becker muscular  dystrophy, and it is sometimes classified as subclinical Becker muscular  dystrophy. People with X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy typically do not have any  skeletal muscle weakness or wasting, although they may have subtle changes in  their skeletal muscle cells that are detectable through laboratory testing.

The condition most often occurs in men older  than age 50. In women, it is four times less common, and also tends to appear  later and be less severe. However, Dupuytren contracture can occur at any time  of life, including childhood. The disorder can make it more difficult for  affected individuals to perform manual tasks such as preparing food, writing, or  playing musical instruments. html:p In about half of cases, Dupuytren contracture occurs in only one hand, affecting  the right hand twice as often as the left. Which hand is affected does not seem  to be related to whether the person is right-handed or left-handed. html:p Dupuytren contracture results from shortening and thickening of bands of fibrous  tissue under the skin of the palm (palmar fascia). Fascia is a type of  connective tissue, which supports the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin  and provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. html:p In Dupuytren contracture the thickening of the fascia typically first appears as  one or more small hard nodules that can be seen and felt under the skin of the  palm. In some affected individuals the nodules remain the only sign of the  disorder, and occasionally even go away without treatment, but in most cases the  condition gradually gets worse. Over months or years, the abnormal fibrous  tissue gets shorter and thicker, developing into tight bands of tissue called  cords. These cords gradually draw the affected fingers downward so that they  curl toward the palm. As the condition gets worse, it becomes difficult or  impossible to extend the affected fingers, resulting in the contracture  associated with this disorder. The ring finger is most often involved, followed  by the little, middle, and index fingers. Occasionally the thumb is involved. html:p Dupuytren contracture is usually not painful, but in some cases people with this  condition experience uncomfortable joint inflammation or sensations of burning  or itching. Pressure or tension may also be experienced, especially when  attempting to straighten affected joints. html:p People with Dupuytren contracture are at increased risk of developing other  disorders in which similar connective tissue abnormalities affect other parts of  the body. These include Garrod pads, which are nodules that develop on the  knuckles; Ledderhose disease, also called plantar fibromatosis, in which  affect the foot; and, in males, Peyronie disease, which causes  abnormal curvature of the penis.

frequency1: Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown. Occasionally, individuals with this disorder are mistakenly diagnosed as having more common blood disorders, making it even more difficult to determine how many people have dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Description1: html:p Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a condition that affects blood  cells and primarily occurs in males. A main feature of this condition is a type  of anemia called dyserythropoietic anemia, which is characterized by a shortage  of red blood cells. The term"dyserythropoietic"refers to the abnormal red  blood cell formation that occurs in this condition. In affected individuals,  immature red blood cells are unusually shaped and cannot develop into functional  mature cells, leading to a shortage of healthy red blood cells. People with  dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have another blood disorder  characterized by a reduced level of circulating platelets (thrombocytopenia).  Platelets are cell fragments that normally assist with blood clotting.  Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. While people  with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have signs and symptoms  of both blood disorders, some are primarily affected by anemia, while others are  more affected by thrombocytopenia. html:p The most severe cases of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia are  characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in  the body before birth. For many others, the signs and symptoms of  dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia begin in infancy. People with this  condition experience prolonged bleeding or bruising after minor trauma or even  in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Anemia can cause pale skin,  weakness, and fatigue. Severe anemia may create a need for frequent blood  transfusions to replenish the supply of red blood cells; however, repeated blood  transfusions over many years can cause health problems such as excess iron in  the blood. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia may also  have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to  recurrent infections. Additionally, they may have an enlarged spleen  (splenomegaly). The severity of these abnormalities varies among affected  individuals. html:p Some people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia have additional  blood disorders such as beta thalassemia or congenital erythropoietic porphyria.  Beta thalassemia is a condition that reduces the production of hemoglobin,  which is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A  decrease in hemoglobin can lead to a shortage of oxygen in cells and tissues  throughout the body. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is another disorder  that impairs hemoglobin production. People with congenital erythropoietic  porphyria are also very sensitive to sunlight, and areas of skin exposed to the  sun can become fragile and blistered.

frequency1: The exact prevalence of dyskeratosis congenita is unknown. It is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 1 million people.
Description1: html:p Dyskeratosis congenita is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body.  There are three features that are characteristic of this disorder: fingernails  and toenails that grow poorly or are abnormally shaped (nail dystrophy); changes  in skin coloring (pigmentation), especially on the neck and chest, in a pattern  often described as"lacy"; and white patches inside the mouth (oral  leukoplakia). html:p People with dyskeratosis congenita have an increased risk of developing several  life-threatening conditions. They are especially vulnerable to disorders that  impair bone marrow function. These disorders disrupt the ability of the bone  marrow to produce new blood cells. Affected individuals may develop aplastic  anemia, also known as bone marrow failure, which occurs when the bone marrow  does not produce enough new blood cells. They are also at higher than average  risk for myelodysplastic syndrome, a condition in which immature blood cells  fail to develop normally; this condition may progress to a form of blood cancer  called leukemia. People with dyskeratosis congenita are also at increased risk  of developing leukemia even if they never develop myelodysplastic syndrome. In  addition, they have a higher than average risk of developing other cancers,  especially cancers of the head, neck, anus, or genitals. html:p People with dyskeratosis congenita may also develop pulmonary fibrosis, a  condition that causes scar tissue (fibrosis) to build up in the lungs,  decreasing the transport of oxygen into the bloodstream. Additional signs and  symptoms that occur in some people with dyskeratosis congenita include eye  abnormalities such as narrow tear ducts that may become blocked, preventing  drainage of tears and leading to eyelid irritation; dental problems; hair loss  or prematurely grey hair; low bone mineral density (osteoporosis);  ; or liver disease. Some  affected males may have narrowing (stenosis) of the urethra, which is the tube  that carries urine out of the body from the bladder. Urethral stenosis may lead  to difficult or painful urination and urinary tract infections. html:p The severity of dyskeratosis congenita varies widely among affected individuals.  The least severely affected individuals have only a few mild physical features  of the disorder and normal bone marrow function. More severely affected  individuals have many of the characteristic physical features and experience  bone marrow failure, cancer, or pulmonary fibrosis by early adulthood. html:p While most people with dyskeratosis congenita have normal intelligence and  ,  may occur in some severely affected individuals. In one severe form of the  disorder called Hoyeraal Hreidaarsson syndrome, affected individuals have an  unusually small and underdeveloped cerebellum, which is the part of the brain  that coordinates movement. Another severe variant called Revesz syndrome  involves abnormalities in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye  (retina) in addition to the other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita.

frequency1: Considered together, the incidence of all types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is estimated to be 6.5 per million newborns in the United States. The severe autosomal recessive forms of this disorder affect fewer than 1 per million newborns.
Description1: html:p Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be  very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response  to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Dystrophic  epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa.  The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely among affected individuals.  In mild cases, blistering may primarily affect the hands, feet, knees, and  elbows. Severe cases of this condition involve widespread blistering that can  lead to vision loss, disfigurement, and other serious medical problems. html:p Researchers classify dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa into three major types.  Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly and  they are caused by mutations in the same gene. html:p Autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Hallopeau-Siemens type  (RDEB-HS) is the most severe, classic form of the condition. Affected infants  are typically born with widespread blistering and areas of missing skin, often  caused by trauma during birth. Most often, blisters are present over the whole  body and affect mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the mouth and  digestive tract. As the blisters heal, they result in severe scarring. Scarring  in the mouth and esophagus can make it difficult to chew and swallow food,  leading to chronic malnutrition and . Additional complications of  progressive scarring can include fusion of the fingers and toes, loss of  fingernails and toenails, that restrict  movement, and eye inflammation leading to vision loss. Additionally, young  adults with the classic form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa have a very  high risk of developing a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma,  which tends to be unusually  and is often life-threatening. html:p A second type of autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is known  as the non-Hallopeau-Siemens type (non-HS RDEB). This form of the condition is  somewhat less severe than the classic type and includes a range of subtypes.  Blistering is limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows in mild cases, but  may be widespread in more severe cases. Affected people often have malformed  fingernails and toenails. Non-HS RDEB involves scarring in the areas where  blisters occur, but this form of the condition does not cause the severe  scarring characteristic of the classic type. html:p The third major type of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is known as the  autosomal dominant type (DDEB). The signs and symptoms of this condition tend  to be milder than those of the autosomal recessive forms, with blistering often  limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows. The blisters heal with scarring,  but it is less severe. Most affected people have malformed fingernails and  toenails, and the nails may be lost over time. In the mildest cases, abnormal  nails are the only sign of the condition.

The term"early-onset glaucoma"may be used when the disorder  appears before the age of 40. html:p In most people with glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerves is caused by  increased pressure within the eyes (intraocular pressure). Intraocular pressure  depends on a balance between fluid entering and leaving the eyes. html:p Usually glaucoma develops in older adults, in whom the risk of developing the  disorder may be affected by a variety of medical conditions including high blood  pressure (hypertension) and diabetes mellitus, as well as family history. The  risk of early-onset glaucoma depends mainly on heredity. html:p Structural abnormalities that impede fluid drainage in the eye may be present at  birth and usually become apparent during the first year of life. Such  abnormalities may be part of a genetic disorder that affects many body systems,  called a syndrome. If glaucoma appears before the age of 5 without other  associated abnormalities, it is called primary congenital glaucoma. html:p Other individuals experience early onset of primary open-angle glaucoma, the  most common adult form of glaucoma. If primary open-angle glaucoma develops  during childhood or early adulthood, it is called juvenile open-angle glaucoma.

Scoliosis, which is an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine, also  develops in late childhood. html:p A form of heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy is another feature of  EOMFC. Dilated cardiomyopathy enlarges and weakens the cardiac muscle,  preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. Signs and symptoms of this  condition can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of breath,  extreme tiredness (fatigue), and swelling of the legs and feet. The heart  abnormalities associated with EOMFC usually become apparent in childhood, after  the skeletal muscle abnormalities. The heart disease worsens quickly, and it  often causes heart failure and sudden death in adolescence or early adulthood.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndrome
frequency1: The combined prevalence of all types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome appears to be at least 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide. The hypermobile and classical forms are most common; the hypermobile type may affect as many as 1 in 5,000 to 20,000 people, while the classical type probably occurs in 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people. Other forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are rare, often with only a few cases or affected families described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues  supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues.  Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of these conditions,  which range from  to life-threatening complications. html:p The various forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have been classified in several  different ways. Originally, 11 forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were named using  Roman numerals to indicate the types (type I, type II, and so on). In 1997,  researchers proposed a simpler classification (the Villefranche nomenclature)  that reduced the number of types to six and gave them descriptive names based on  their major features. In 2017, the classification was up-dated to include rare  forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that were discovered more recently. The 2017  classification describes 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. html:p An unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) occurs in most forms  of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and it is a hallmark feature of the hypermobile type.  Infants and children with hypermobility often have  (), which can  . The are unstable and prone to dislocation  and chronic pain. In the arthrochalasia type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, infants  have hypermobility and dislocations of both hips at birth. html:p Many people with the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes have soft, velvety skin that is  highly stretchy (elastic) and fragile. Affected individuals tend to bruise  easily, and some types of the condition also cause abnormal scarring. People  with the classical form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience wounds that split  open with little bleeding and leave scars that widen over time to create  characteristic"cigarette paper"scars. The dermatosparaxis type of the disorder  is characterized by loose skin that sags and wrinkles, and extra (redundant)  folds of skin may be present. html:p Some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, notably the vascular type and to a lesser  extent the kyphoscoliotic, classical, and classical-like types, can cause  unpredictable tearing (rupture) of blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding  and other potentially life-threatening complications. The vascular type of  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of organ  rupture, including tearing of the intestine and rupture of the uterus during  pregnancy. html:p Other types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have additional signs and symptoms. The  cardiac-valvular type causes severe problems with the valves that control the  movement of blood through the heart. People with the kyphoscoliotic type  experience severe curvature of the spine that worsens over time and can  interfere with breathing by restricting lung expansion. A type of Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome called brittle cornea syndrome is characterized by thinness of the  clear covering of the eye (the cornea) and other eye abnormalities. The  spondylodysplastic type features  and skeletal abnormalities such  as abnormally curved (bowed) limbs. Abnormalities of muscles, including  And , are among the  characteristic signs of the musculocontractural and myopathic forms of  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The periodontal type causes abnormalities of the teeth  and gums.

Description1: html:p Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is an inherited disorder of bone growth that results  in very  (dwarfism). People with this condition have particularly  short forearms and lower legs and a narrow chest with short ribs. Ellis-van  Creveld syndrome is also characterized by the presence of extra fingers and toes  (polydactyly), malformed fingernails and toenails, and dental abnormalities.  More than half of affected individuals are born with a , which can  cause serious or life-threatening health problems. html:p The features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome overlap with those of another, milder  condition called Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Like Ellis-van Creveld syndrome,  Weyers acrofacial dysostosis involves tooth and nail abnormalities, although  affected individuals have less pronounced  and typically do not  have s. The two conditions are caused by mutations in the same  genes.

The prevalence of the autosomal dominant type is unknown, although it appears to be more common than the X-linked type. The autosomal recessive type appears to be very rare; only a few cases have been reported worldwide.

Among the  earliest features of this disorder are  ,  and usually become noticeable in early childhood. Most  affected individuals also experience muscle weakness and wasting that worsen  slowly over time, beginning in muscles of the upper arms and lower legs and  later also affecting muscles in the shoulders and hips. html:p Almost all people with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy develop heart problems  by adulthood. In many cases, these heart problems are abnormalities of the  electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects) and  s (arrhythmias). If untreated, these abnormalities can lead  to a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), an  unusually slow heartbeat (bradycardia), fainting (syncope), heart failure, and  an increased risk of sudden death. html:p Researchers have identified several types of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy  that are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: X-linked, autosomal  dominant, and autosomal recessive. The types usually have similar signs and  symptoms, although a small percentage of people with the autosomal dominant form  experience heart problems without any weakness or wasting of skeletal muscles.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">An epidermal nevus (plural: nevi) is an abnormal, noncancerous (benign) patch of</span>  skin caused by an overgrowth of cells in the outermost layer of skin  (epidermis). Epidermal nevi are typically seen at birth or develop in early  childhood. Affected individuals have one or more nevi that vary in size. html:p There are several types of epidermal nevus that are defined in part by the type  of epidermal cell involved. The epidermis is composed primarily of a specific  cell type called a keratinocyte. One group of epidermal nevi, called  keratinocytic or nonorganoid epidermal nevi, includes nevi that involve only  keratinocytes. Keratinocytic epidermal nevi are typically found on the torso or  limbs. They can be flat, tan or brown patches of skin or raised, velvety  patches. As affected individuals age, the nevi can become thicker and darker and  develop a wart-like (verrucous) appearance. Often, keratinocytic epidermal nevi  follow a pattern on the skin known as the lines of Blaschko. The lines of  Blaschko, which are normally invisible on skin, are thought to follow the paths  along which cells migrate as the skin develops before birth. Keratinocytic  epidermal nevi are also known as linear epidermal nevi or verrucous epidermal  nevi, based on characteristics of their appearance. html:p Other types of epidermal nevi involve additional types of epidermal cells, such  as the cells that make up the hair follicles, the sweat glands, or the sebaceous  glands (glands in the skin that produce a substance that protects the skin and  hair). These nevi comprise a group called organoid epidermal nevi. A common type  of organoid epidermal nevus is called nevus sebaceous. Nevi in this group are  waxy, yellow-orange patches of skin, usually on the scalp or face. The patch is  typically hairless, leaving a distinct region of baldness (alopecia). Similar to  keratinocytic epidermal nevi, nevi sebaceous can become thicker and more  verrucous over time. In about one-quarter of people with a nevus sebaceous, a  tumor forms in the same region as the nevus. The tumor is usually benign,  although rarely cancerous (malignant) tumors develop. html:p Some affected individuals have only an epidermal nevus and no other  abnormalities. However, sometimes people with an epidermal nevus also have  problems in other body systems, such as the brain, eyes, or bones. In these  cases, the affected individual has a condition called an epidermal nevus  syndrome. There are several different epidermal nevus syndromes characterized by  the type of epidermal nevus involved.

frequency1: The exact prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa simplex is unknown, but this condition is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 people. The localized type is the most common form of the condition.
Description1: html:p Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is one of a group of genetic conditions called  epidermolysis bullosa that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister  easily. Blisters and areas of skin loss (erosions) occur in response to minor  injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex  is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa. The signs and symptoms of  this condition vary widely among affected individuals. Blistering primarily  affects the hands and feet in mild cases, and the blisters usually heal without  leaving scars. Severe cases of this condition involve widespread blistering that  can lead to infections, dehydration, and other medical problems. Severe cases  may be life-threatening in infancy. html:p Researchers have identified four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.  Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and  they are caused by mutations in the same genes. Most researchers now consider  the major forms of this condition to be part of a single disorder with a range  of signs and symptoms. html:p The mildest form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, known as the localized type  (formerly called the Weber-Cockayne type), is characterized by skin blistering  that begins anytime between childhood and adulthood and is usually limited to  the hands and feet. Later in life, skin on the palms of the hands and soles of  the feet may thicken and harden (hyperkeratosis). html:p The Dowling-Meara type is the most severe form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.  Extensive, severe blistering can occur anywhere on the body, including the  inside of the mouth, and blisters may appear in clusters. Blistering is present  from birth and tends to improve with age. Affected individuals also experience  abnormal nail growth and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. html:p Another form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, known as the other generalized  type (formerly called the Koebner type), is associated with widespread blisters  that appear at birth or in early infancy. The blistering tends to be less severe  than in the Dowling-Meara type. html:p Epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation is characterized by  patches of darker skin on the trunk, arms, and legs that fade in adulthood. This  form of the disorder also involves skin blistering from early infancy,  hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, and abnormal nail growth. html:p In addition to the four major types described above, researchers have identified  another skin condition related to epidermolysis bullosa simplex, which they  call the Ogna type. It is caused by mutations in a gene that is not associated  with the other types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. It is unclear whether  the Ogna type is a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa simplex or represents a  separate form of epidermolysis bullosa. html:p Several other variants of epidermolysis bullosa simplex have been proposed, but  they appear to be very rare.

frequency1: EB-PA appears to be a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown. At least 50 affected individuals have been reported worldwide.
Description1: html:p Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA) is a condition that affects  the skin and digestive tract. This condition is one of several forms of  epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be  fragile and to blister easily. Affected infants are often born with widespread  blistering and areas of missing skin. Blisters continue to appear in response to  minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Most often, blisters  occur over the whole body and affect mucous membranes such as the moist lining  of the mouth and digestive tract. html:p People with EB-PA are also born with pyloric atresia, which is an obstruction of  the lower part of the stomach (the pylorus). This obstruction prevents food  from emptying out of the stomach into the intestine. Signs of pyloric atresia  include vomiting, a swollen (distended) abdomen, and an absence of stool.  Pyloric atresia is life-threatening and must be repaired with surgery soon after  birth. html:p Other complications of EB-PA can include fusion of the skin between the fingers  and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails,  that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). Some affected  individuals are also born with malformations of the urinary tract, including the  kidneys and bladder. html:p Because the signs and symptoms of EB-PA are so severe, many infants with this  condition do not survive beyond the first year of life. In those who survive,  the condition may improve with time; some affected individuals have little or no  blistering later in life. However, many affected individuals who live past  infancy experience severe medical problems, including blistering and the  formation of red, bumpy patches called granulation tissue. Granulation tissue  most often forms on the skin around the mouth, nose, fingers, and toes. It can  also build up in the airway, leading to difficulty breathing.

This thickened skin is usually darker than normal. Bacteria can  grow in the thick skin, often causing a distinct odor. html:p Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis can be categorized into two types. People with  PS-type epidermolytic hyperkeratosis have thick skin on the palms of their hands  and soles of their feet (palmoplantar or palm/sole hyperkeratosis) in addition  to other areas of the body. People with the other type, NPS-type, do not have  extensive palmoplantar hyperkeratosis but do have hyperkeratosis on other areas  of the body. html:p Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is part of a group of conditions called ichthyoses,  which refers to the scaly skin seen in individuals with related disorders.  However, in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, the skin is thick but not scaly as in  some of the other conditions in the group.

It is</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">estimated to occur in 1 in 5,000 children younger than 16.</span>
Description1: html:p The -aphasia spectrum is a group of conditions that have overlapping  signs and symptoms. A key feature of these conditions is impairment of  skills (aphasia). The  problems can affect speaking, reading, and  writing. Another feature of -aphasia spectrum disorders is certain  patterns of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which are detected by a  test called an electroencephalogram (EEG). Many people with conditions in this  spectrum develop recurrent  (), and some have mild to severe  disability. The conditions in the -aphasia spectrum, which  all begin in childhood, include Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), epileptic  encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (ECSWS),  autosomal dominant rolandic  with  dyspraxia (ADRESD),  intermediate -aphasia disorder (IEAD), atypical childhood  with  centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS), and childhood  with centrotemporal  spikes (CECTS). html:p LKS and ECSWS are at the severe end of the spectrum. Both usually feature a  characteristic abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the brain called  continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS). This pattern occurs  while the affected child is sleeping, specifically during deep (slow-wave)  sleep. html:p Most children with LKS develop normally in early childhood, although some speak  later than their peers. However, affected children lose  skills  beginning around age 5. This loss typically begins with verbal agnosia, which is  the inability to understand . As LKS develops, the ability to express  is also impaired. Approximately 70 percent of children with LKS have  , typically of a type described as focal (or partial) because the  seizure activity occurs in specific regions of the brain rather than affecting  the entire brain. html:p About half of children with ECSWS develop normally in early childhood, while  others have .

Affected children  have rolandic ; these  are triggered by abnormal activity in an  area of the brain called the rolandic region, which is part of the cerebrum. The  , which usually occur during sleep, cause twitching, numbness, or  tingling of the face or tongue, often causing drooling and impairing . In  most people with CECTS, the  disappear by the end of adolescence. Most  affected individuals develop normally, although some have difficulty  coordinating the movements of the mouth and tongue needed for clear  (dyspraxia) or impairment of  skills. html:p The other conditions in the -aphasia spectrum are less common and fall  in the middle of the spectrum. Children with IEAD usually have  . Some have  and most have  abnormal electrical activity in their brains during sleep, although it is not  prominent enough to be classified as CSWS. ACECTS features  and  .  Children with ACECTS have abnormal electrical activity in the brain that is  sometimes classified as CSWS. ADRESD is characterized by focal ,  difficulties due to dyspraxia, and  disability.

During these episodes, many  people also experience dizziness (vertigo), nausea and vomiting, migraine  headaches, blurred or double vision, slurred , and ringing in the ears  (tinnitus). , muscle weakness, and paralysis affecting one side of the  body (hemiplegia) may also occur during attacks. Additionally, some affected  individuals have a muscle abnormality called myokymia during or between  episodes. This abnormality can cause muscle cramping, stiffness, and  continuous, fine muscle twitching that appears as rippling under the skin. html:p Episodes of ataxia and other symptoms can begin anytime from early childhood to  adulthood. They can be triggered by environmental factors such as emotional  stress, caffeine, alcohol, certain medications, physical activity, and illness.  The frequency of attacks ranges from several per day to one or two per year.  Between episodes, some affected individuals continue to experience ataxia, which  may worsen over time, as well as involuntary eye movements called nystagmus. html:p Researchers have identified at least seven types of episodic ataxia, designated  type 1 through type 7. The types are distinguished by their pattern of signs  and symptoms, age of onset, length of attacks, and, when known, genetic cause.

More than 500 affected individuals worldwide have been described in the <span style="background:#FFFF00;">medical literature. For unknown reasons, men are slightly more likely to</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">develop the disease, accounting for about 60 percent of cases.</span>
Description1: html:p Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare type of slow-growing blood cancer called a  histiocytic neoplasm, which results in overproduction of cells called  histiocytes. Histiocytes normally function to destroy foreign substances and  protect the body from infection. In Erdheim-Chester disease, the excess  production of histiocytes (histiocytosis) leads to inflammation that can damage  organs and tissues throughout the body, causing them to become thickened, dense,  and scarred (fibrotic); this tissue damage may lead to organ failure. html:p People with Erdheim-Chester disease often have bone pain, especially in the  lower legs and upper arms, due to an abnormal increase in bone density  (osteosclerosis). Damage to the pituitary gland (a structure at the base of the  brain that produces several hormones, including a hormone that controls the  amount of water released in the urine) may result in hormonal problems such as a  condition called diabetes insipidus that leads to excessive urination.  Abnormally high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid within the skull  (intracranial hypertension) caused by accumulation of histiocytes in the brain  may result in headaches, , cognitive impairment, or problems with  movement or sensation. People with this condition can also have shortness of  breath, heart or kidney disease, protruding eyes (exophthalmos), skin growths,  or inability to conceive a child (infertility). Affected individuals may also  experience fever, night sweats, fatigue, weakness, and weight loss. html:p The signs and symptoms of Erdheim-Chester disease usually appear between the  ages of 40 and 60, although the disorder can occur at any age. The severity of  the condition varies widely; some affected individuals have few or no associated  health problems, while others have severe complications that can be  life-threatening.

frequency1: EKVP is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva (EKVP) is a skin disorder that is  present at birth or becomes apparent in infancy. Although its signs and symptoms  vary, the condition is characterized by two major features. The first is areas  of hyperkeratosis, which is rough, thickened skin. These thickened patches are  usually reddish-brown and can either be widespread over many parts of the body  or occur only in a small area. They tend to be fixed, meaning they do not spread  or go away. However, the patches can vary in size and shape, and in some  affected people they get larger over time. The areas of thickened skin are  generally symmetric, which means they occur in the same places on the right and  left sides of the body. html:p The second major feature of EKVP is patches of reddened skin called erythematous  areas. Unlike the hyperkeratosis that occurs in this disorder, the erythematous  areas are usually transient, which means they come and go. They vary in size,  shape, and location, and can occur anywhere on the body. The redness can be  triggered by sudden changes in temperature, emotional stress, or trauma or  irritation to the area. It usually fades within hours to days.

Description1: html:p Erythromelalgia is a condition characterized by episodes of pain, redness, and  swelling in various parts of the body, particularly the hands and feet. These  episodes are usually triggered by increased body temperature, which may be  caused by exercise or entering a warm room. Ingesting alcohol or spicy foods may  also trigger an episode.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is a condition resulting</span>  from  before birth of the tube that carries food from the  mouth to the stomach (the esophagus). During early development, the esophagus  and windpipe (trachea) begin as a single tube that normally divides into the two  adjacent passages between four and eight weeks after conception. If this  separation does not occur properly, EA/TEF is the result. html:p In esophageal atresia (EA), the upper esophagus does not connect (atresia) to  the lower esophagus and stomach. Almost 90 percent of babies born with  esophageal atresia also have a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), in which the  esophagus and the trachea are abnormally connected, allowing fluids from the  esophagus to get into the airways and interfere with breathing. A small number  of infants have only one of these abnormalities. html:p There are several types of EA/TEF, classified by the location of the  malformation and the structures that are affected. In more than 80 percent of  cases, the lower section of the malformed esophagus is connected to the trachea  (EA with a distal TEF). Other possible configurations include having the upper  section of the malformed esophagus connected to the trachea (EA with a proximal  TEF), connections to the trachea from both the upper and lower sections of the  malformed esophagus (EA with proximal and distal TEF), an esophagus that is  malformed but does not connect to the trachea (isolated EA), and a connection to  the trachea from an otherwise normal esophagus (H-type TEF with no EA). html:p While EA/TEF arises during fetal development, it generally becomes apparent  shortly after birth. Saliva, liquids fed to the infant, or digestive fluids may  enter the windpipe through the tracheoesophageal fistula, leading to coughing,  respiratory distress, and a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis).  Esophageal atresia blocks liquids fed to the infant from entering the stomach,  so they are spit back up, sometimes along with fluids from the respiratory  tract. EA/TEF is a life-threatening condition; affected babies generally require  surgery to correct the malformation in order to allow feeding and prevent lung  damage from repeated exposure to esophageal fluids. html:p EA/TEF occurs alone (isolated EA/TEF) in about 40 percent of affected  individuals. In other cases it occurs with other birth defects or as part of a  genetic syndrome (non-isolated or syndromic EA/TEF).

Description1: html:p Essential thrombocythemia is a condition characterized by an increased number of  platelets (thrombocythemia). Platelets (thrombocytes) are blood cell fragments  involved in blood clotting. While some people with this condition have no  symptoms, others develop problems associated with the excess platelets. html:p Abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis) is common in people with essential  thrombocythemia and causes many signs and symptoms of this condition. Clots that  block blood flow to the brain can cause strokes or temporary stroke-like  episodes known as transient ischemic attacks. Thrombosis in the legs can cause  leg pain, swelling, or both. In addition, clots can travel to the lungs  (pulmonary embolism), blocking blood flow in the lungs and causing chest pain  and difficulty breathing (dyspnea). html:p Another problem in essential thrombocythemia is abnormal bleeding, which occurs  more often in people with a very high number of platelets. Affected people may  have nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is  thought that bleeding occurs because a specific protein in the blood that helps  with clotting is reduced, although why the protein is reduced is unclear. html:p Other signs and symptoms of essential thrombocythemia include an enlarged spleen  (splenomegaly); weakness; headaches; or a sensation in the skin of burning,  tingling, or prickling.

frequency1: About 70 individuals with this condition have been identified worldwide, mostly in Mediterranean and Arab populations. Although ethylmalonic encephalopathy appears to be very rare, researchers suggest that some cases have been misdiagnosed as other neurological disorders.
Description1: html:p Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is an inherited disorder that affects several body  systems, particularly the nervous system. Neurological signs and symptoms  include  (), , and abnormal  movements. The body's network of blood vessels (the vascular system) is also  affected. Children with this disorder often develop rashes of tiny red spots  (petechiae) caused by bleeding under the skin and blue discoloration in the  hands and feet due to reduced oxygen in the blood (acrocyanosis). Chronic  diarrhea is another common feature of ethylmalonic encephalopathy. html:p The signs and symptoms of ethylmalonic encephalopathy are apparent at birth or  begin in the first few months of life. Problems with the nervous system  typically worsen over time, and most affected individuals survive only into  early childhood.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ewing-sarcoma
frequency1: Approximately 3 per 1 million children each year are diagnosed with a Ewing sarcoma. It is estimated that, in the United States, 250 children are diagnosed with one of these types of tumor each year. Ewing sarcoma accounts for about 1.5 percent of all childhood cancers, and it is the second most common type of bone tumor in children (the most common type of bone cancer is called osteosarcoma).
Description1: html:p Ewing sarcoma is a cancerous tumor that occurs in bones or soft tissues, such as  cartilage or nerves. There are several types of Ewing sarcoma, including Ewing  sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, peripheral primitive  neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET), and Askin tumor. These tumors are considered to  be related because they have similar genetic causes. These types of Ewing  sarcoma can be distinguished from one another by the tissue in which the tumor  develops. Approximately 87 percent of Ewing sarcomas are Ewing sarcoma of bone,  which is a bone tumor that usually occurs in the thigh bones (femurs), pelvis,  ribs, or shoulder blades. Extraosseous (or extraskeletal) Ewing sarcoma  describes tumors in the soft tissues around bones, such as cartilage. pPNETs  occur in nerve tissue and can be found in many parts of the body. A type of  pPNET found in the chest is called Askin tumor. html:p Ewing sarcomas most often occur in children and young adults. Affected  individuals usually feel stiffness, pain, swelling, or tenderness of the bone or  surrounding tissue. Sometimes, there is a lump near the surface of the skin  that feels warm and soft to the touch. Often, children have a fever that does  not go away. Ewing sarcoma of bone can cause weakening of the involved bone, and  affected individuals may have a broken bone with no obvious cause. html:p It is common for Ewing sarcoma to spread to other parts of the body  (metastasize), usually to the lungs, to other bones, or to the bone marrow.

Description1: html:p Fabry disease is an inherited disorder that results from the buildup of a  particular type of fat, called globotriaosylceramide, in the body's cells.  Beginning in childhood, this buildup causes signs and symptoms that affect many  parts of the body. Characteristic features of Fabry disease include episodes of  pain, particularly in the hands and feet (acroparesthesias); clusters of small,  dark red spots on the skin called angiokeratomas; a decreased ability to sweat  (hypohidrosis); cloudiness of the front part of the eye (corneal opacity);  problems with the gastrointestinal system; ringing in the ears (tinnitus); and  hearing loss. Fabry disease also involves potentially life-threatening  complications such as progressive kidney damage, heart attack, and stroke. Some  affected individuals have milder forms of the disorder that appear later in life  and affect only the heart or kidneys.

About 95 percent of all cases are FSHD1; the remaining 5 percent</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">are FSHD2.</span>
Description1: html:p Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a disorder characterized by muscle  weakness and wasting (atrophy). This condition gets its name from the muscles  that are affected most often: those of the face (facio-), around the shoulder  blades (scapulo-), and in the upper arms (humeral). The signs and symptoms of  facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy usually appear in adolescence. However,  the onset and severity of the condition varies widely. Milder cases may not  become noticeable until later in life, whereas rare severe cases become apparent  in infancy or early childhood. html:p Weakness involving the facial muscles or shoulders is usually the first symptom  of this condition. Facial muscle weakness often makes it difficult to drink from  a straw, whistle, or turn up the corners of the mouth when smiling. Weakness in  muscles around the eyes can prevent the eyes from closing fully while a person  is asleep, which can lead to dry eyes and other eye problems. For reasons that  are unclear, weakness may be more severe in one side of the face than the other.  Weak shoulder muscles tend to make the shoulder blades (scapulae) protrude  from the back, a common sign known as scapular winging. Weakness in muscles of  the shoulders and upper arms can make it difficult to raise the arms over the  head or throw a ball. html:p The muscle weakness associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy  worsens slowly over decades and may spread to other parts of the body. Weakness  in muscles of the lower legs can lead to a condition called foot drop, which  affects walking and increases the risk of falls. Muscular weakness in the hips  and pelvis can make it difficult to climb stairs or walk long distances.  Additionally, affected individuals may have an exaggerated curvature of the  lower back (lordosis) due to weak abdominal muscles. About 20 percent of  affected individuals eventually require the use of a wheelchair. html:p Additional signs and symptoms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy can  include mild high-tone hearing loss and abnormalities involving the  light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). These signs are  often not noticeable and may be discovered only during medical testing. Rarely,  facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy affects the heart (cardiac) muscle or  muscles needed for breathing. html:p Researchers have described two types of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy:  type 1 (FSHD1) and type 2 (FSHD2). The two types have the same signs and  symptoms and are distinguished by their genetic cause.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is an inherited disorder of blood clotting. Factor</span>  V Leiden is the name of a specific gene mutation that results in thrombophilia,  which is an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots that can block  blood vessels. html:p People with factor V Leiden thrombophilia have a higher than average risk of  developing a type of blood clot called a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVTs  occur most often in the legs, although they can also occur in other parts of the  body, including the brain, eyes, liver, and kidneys. Factor V Leiden  thrombophilia also increases the risk that clots will break away from their  original site and travel through the bloodstream. These clots can lodge in the  lungs, where they are known as pulmonary emboli. Although factor V Leiden  thrombophilia increases the risk of blood clots, only about 10 percent of  individuals with the factor V Leiden mutation ever develop abnormal clots. html:p The factor V Leiden mutation is associated with a slightly increased risk of  pregnancy loss (miscarriage). Women with this mutation are two to three times  more likely to have multiple (recurrent) miscarriages or a pregnancy loss during  the second or third trimester. Some research suggests that the factor V Leiden  mutation may also increase the risk of other complications during pregnancy,  including pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), slow fetal  growth, and early separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placental  abruption). However, the association between the factor V Leiden mutation and  these complications has not been confirmed. Most women with factor V Leiden  thrombophilia have normal pregnancies.

The severe deficiency disorder is much more common in people with central and eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry, occurring in about 1 in 450 individuals in that population. Researchers suggest that the actual prevalence of factor XI deficiency may be higher than reported, because mild cases of the disorder often do not come to medical attention.
Description1: html:p Factor XI deficiency is a disorder that can cause abnormal bleeding due to a  shortage (deficiency) of the factor XI protein, which is involved in blood  clotting. This condition is classified as either partial or severe based on the  degree of deficiency of the factor XI protein. However, regardless of the  severity of the protein deficiency, most affected individuals have relatively  mild bleeding problems, and some people with this disorder have few if any  symptoms. The most common feature of factor XI deficiency is prolonged bleeding  after trauma or surgery, especially involving the inside of the mouth and nose  (oral and nasal cavities) or the urinary tract. If the bleeding is left  untreated after surgery, solid swellings consisting of congealed blood  (hematomas) can develop in the surgical area. html:p Other signs and symptoms of this disorder can include frequent nosebleeds, easy  bruising, bleeding under the skin, and bleeding of the gums. Women with this  disorder can have heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) or  prolonged bleeding after childbirth. In contrast to some other bleeding  disorders, spontaneous bleeding into the urine (hematuria), gastrointestinal  tract, or skull cavity are not common in factor XI deficiency, although they can  occur in severely affected individuals. Bleeding into the muscles or joints,  which can cause long-term disability in other bleeding disorders, generally does  not occur in this condition.

The condition can also cause spontaneous bleeding  into the joints or muscles, leading to pain and disability. Women with  inherited factor XIII deficiency tend to have heavy or prolonged menstrual  bleeding (menorrhagia) and may experience recurrent pregnancy losses  (miscarriages). Other signs and symptoms of inherited factor XIII deficiency  include nosebleeds, bleeding of the gums, easy bruising, problems with wound  healing, and abnormal scar formation. Inherited factor XIII deficiency also  increases the risk of spontaneous bleeding inside the skull (intracranial  hemorrhage), which is the leading cause of death in people with this condition. html:p Acquired factor XIII deficiency becomes apparent later in life.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited disorder characterized by</span>  cancer of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. People with the classic type  of familial adenomatous polyposis may begin to develop multiple noncancerous  (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon as early as their teenage years. Unless  the colon is removed, these polyps will become malignant (cancerous). The  average age at which an individual develops colon cancer in classic familial  adenomatous polyposis is 39 years. Some people have a variant of the disorder,  called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, in which polyp growth is  delayed. The average age of colorectal cancer onset for attenuated familial  adenomatous polyposis is 55 years. html:p In people with classic familial adenomatous polyposis, the number of polyps  increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the  colon. Also of particular significance are noncancerous growths called desmoid  tumors. These fibrous tumors usually occur in the tissue covering the intestines  and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. Desmoid tumors tend to  recur after they are surgically removed. In both classic familial adenomatous  polyposis and its attenuated variant, benign and malignant tumors are sometimes  found in other places in the body, including the duodenum (a section of the  small intestine), stomach, bones, skin, and other tissues. People who have colon  polyps as well as growths outside the colon are sometimes described as having  Gardner syndrome. html:p A milder type of familial adenomatous polyposis, called autosomal recessive  familial adenomatous polyposis, has also been identified. People with the  autosomal recessive type of this disorder have fewer polyps than those with the  classic type. Fewer than 100 polyps typically develop, rather than hundreds or  thousands. The autosomal recessive type of this disorder is caused by mutations  in a different gene than the classic and attenuated types of familial  adenomatous polyposis.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Familial atrial fibrillation is an inherited abnormality of the heart's normal</span>  rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by episodes of uncoordinated  electrical activity (fibrillation) in the heart's upper chambers (the atria),  which cause a fast and irregular heartbeat. If untreated, this abnormal heart  rhythm (arrhythmia) can lead to dizziness, chest pain, a sensation of fluttering  or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, or fainting  (syncope). Atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of stroke and sudden  death. Complications of atrial fibrillation can occur at any age, although some  people with this heart condition never experience any health problems associated  with the disorder.

Skin infections lead to a rash with crusty,  thickened patches; when these patches occur on the scalp, they can cause loss of  hair in the affected area (scarring alopecia). Candidiasis of the nails can  result in thick, cracked, and discolored nails and swelling and redness of the  surrounding skin. Thrush and gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating,  constipation, or diarrhea are common in affected individuals. Women with  familial candidiasis can develop frequent vaginal yeast infections, and infants  can have yeast infections on the skin that cause persistent diaper rash. html:p Depending on the genetic change involved in this condition, some affected  individuals are at risk for developing systemic candidiasis, a more severe  condition in which the infection spreads through the bloodstream to various  organs including the brain and the meninges, which are the membranes covering  the brain and spinal cord. Systemic candidiasis can be life-threatening. html:p Chronic or recurrent yeast infections can occur in people without familial  candidiasis. Some individuals experience recurrent candidiasis as part of a  general susceptibility to infections because their immune systems are impaired  by a disease such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe  combined immunodeficiency (SCID), medications, or other factors. Other  individuals have syndromes such as autoimmune  polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) or autosomal  dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) that include a tendency to develop  candidiasis along with other signs and symptoms affecting various organs and  systems of the body.
Inheritance-pattern1: inheritance-pattern               (candidiasis) in the mouth (where it is known as thrush) or in the vagina.  These episodes, commonly called yeast infections, usually last only a short time  before being cleared by a healthy immune system.

frequency1: Familial cylindromatosis is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Familial cylindromatosis is a condition involving multiple skin tumors that  develop from structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as  hair follicles and sweat glands. People with familial cylindromatosis typically  develop large numbers of tumors called cylindromas. While previously thought to  derive from sweat glands, cylindromas are now generally believed to begin in  hair follicles. html:p Individuals with familial cylindromatosis occasionally develop other types of  tumors, including growths called spiradenomas and trichoepitheliomas.  Spiradenomas begin in sweat glands. Trichoepitheliomas arise from hair  follicles. The tumors associated with familial cylindromatosis are generally  noncancerous (benign), but occasionally they may become cancerous (malignant).  Affected individuals are also at increased risk of developing tumors in tissues  other than skin appendages, particularly benign or malignant tumors of the  salivary glands. html:p People with familial cylindromatosis typically begin developing tumors in  adolescence or early adulthood. The tumors are most often found in hairy regions  of the body, with approximately 90 percent occurring on the head and neck. They  grow larger and increase in number over time. html:p In severely affected individuals, multiple tumors on the scalp may combine into  a large, turban-like growth. Large growths frequently develop open sores  (ulcers) and are prone to infections. The tumors may also get in the way of the  eyes, ears, nose, or mouth and affect vision, hearing, or other functions. The  growths can be disfiguring and may contribute to  or other  psychological problems. For reasons that are unclear, females with familial  cylindromatosis are often more severely affected than males.

It occurs</span>  when heart (cardiac) muscle becomes thin and weakened in at least one chamber of  the heart, causing the open area of the chamber to become enlarged (dilated).  As a result, the heart is unable to pump blood as efficiently as usual. To  compensate, the heart attempts to increase the amount of blood being pumped  through the heart, leading to further thinning and weakening of the cardiac  muscle. Over time, this condition results in heart failure. html:p It usually takes many years for symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy to  cause health problems. They typically begin in mid-adulthood, but can occur at  any time from infancy to late adulthood. Signs and symptoms of familial dilated  cardiomyopathy can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of  breath (dyspnea), extreme tiredness (fatigue), fainting episodes (syncope), and  swelling of the legs and feet. In some cases, the first sign of the disorder is  sudden cardiac death. The severity of the condition varies among affected  individuals, even in members of the same family.

Early signs and  symptoms include poor muscle tone (), feeding difficulties,  , lack of tears, frequent lung infections, and difficulty maintaining body  temperature. Older infants and young children with familial dysautonomia may  hold their breath for prolonged periods of time, which may cause a bluish  appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis) or fainting. This breath-holding  behavior usually stops by age 6.  , although some affected individuals show no signs of   html:p Additional signs and symptoms in school-age children include bed wetting,  episodes of vomiting, reduced sensitivity to temperature changes and pain, poor  balance, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), poor bone quality and  increased risk of bone fractures, and kidney and heart problems. Affected  individuals also have poor regulation of blood pressure. They may experience a  sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension), which can  cause dizziness, blurred vision, or fainting. They can also have episodes of  high blood pressure when nervous or excited, or during vomiting incidents. About  one-third of children with familial dysautonomia have  disabilities,  such as a , that require special education classes. By  adulthood, affected individuals often have increasing difficulties with balance  and walking unaided. Other problems that may appear in adolescence or early  adulthood include lung damage due to repeated infections, impaired kidney  function, and worsening vision due to the shrinking size (atrophy) of optic  nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain.

The primary function of these cells is  to carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs throughout the body. Signs  and symptoms of familial erythrocytosis can include headaches, dizziness,  nosebleeds, and shortness of breath. The excess red blood cells also increase  the risk of developing abnormal blood clots that can block the flow of blood  through arteries and veins. If these clots restrict blood flow to essential  organs and tissues (particularly the heart, lungs, or brain), they can cause  life-threatening complications such as a heart attack or stroke. However, many  people with familial erythrocytosis experience only mild signs and symptoms or  never have any problems related to their extra red blood cells.

Description1: html:p Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a hereditary disorder that can cause  progressive vision loss. This condition affects the retina, the specialized  light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye.

In many affected individuals, the retinal  abnormalities never cause any vision problems. In others, a reduction in the  retina's blood supply causes the retina to fold, tear, or separate from the back  of the eye (retinal detachment). This retinal damage can lead to vision loss  and blindness. Other eye abnormalities are also possible, including eyes that  do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and a visible whiteness  (leukocoria) in the normally black pupil. html:p Some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy also have reduced bone  mineral density, which weakens bones and increases the risk of fractures.

Description1: html:p Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal  glands, which are hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney, do not  produce certain hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include  cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in  maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the  brain, and serve many other purposes in the body. html:p A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) causes the signs and  symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. These signs and symptoms often  begin in infancy or early childhood. Most affected children first develop low  blood sugar (hypoglycemia). These hypoglycemic children can fail to grow and  gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). If left untreated,  hypoglycemia can lead to ,  difficulties, and other neurological  problems. Hypoglycemia that is left untreated for prolonged periods can lead to  neurological damage and death. Other features of familial glucocorticoid  deficiency can include recurrent infections and skin coloring darker than that  of other family members (hyperpigmentation). html:p There are multiple types of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, which are  distinguished by their genetic cause.

frequency1: Familial HDL deficiency is a rare disorder, although the prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Familial HDL deficiency is a condition characterized by low levels of  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the blood. HDL is a molecule that transports  cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids through the bloodstream from  the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and  phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. HDL  is often referred to as"good cholesterol"because high levels of this substance  reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular)  disease. People with familial HDL deficiency may develop cardiovascular disease  at a relatively young age, often before age 50. html:p Severely reduced levels of HDL in the blood is a characteristic feature of a  related disorder called Tangier disease. People with Tangier disease have  additional signs and symptoms, such as disturbances in nerve function; enlarged,  orange-colored tonsils; and clouding of the clear covering of the eye (corneal  clouding). However, people with familial HDL deficiency do not have these  additional features.

Description1: html:p Familial hemiplegic migraine is a form of migraine headache that runs in  families. Migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the  head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light  and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence  and can be triggered by certain foods, emotional stress, and minor head trauma.  Each headache may last from a few hours to a few days. html:p In some types of migraine, including familial hemiplegic migraine, a pattern of  neurological symptoms called an aura precedes the headache. The most common  symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind  spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In  people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by  temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body  (hemiparesis).

Description1: html:p Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a disorder in which the immune  system produces too many activated immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells,  natural killer cells, B cells, and macrophages (histiocytes). Excessive amounts  of immune system proteins called cytokines are also produced. This  overactivation of the immune system causes fever and damages the liver and  spleen, resulting in enlargement of these organs. html:p Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also destroys blood-producing cells  in the bone marrow, a process called hemophagocytosis. As a result, affected  individuals have low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the  number of platelets, which are involved in clotting. A reduction in platelets  may cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. html:p The brain may also be affected in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.  As a result, affected individuals may experience irritability, delayed closure  of the bones of the skull in infants, neck stiffness, abnormal muscle tone,  impaired muscle coordination, paralysis, blindness, , and coma. In  addition to neurological problems, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  can cause abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues.  Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing cancers of  blood-forming cells (leukemia and lymphoma). html:p Signs and symptoms of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis usually become  apparent during infancy, although occasionally they appear later in life. They  usually occur when the immune system launches an exaggerated response to an  infection, but may also occur in the absence of infection. Without treatment,  most people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis survive only a few  months.

Description1: html:p Familial hyperaldosteronism is a group of inherited conditions in which the  adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney, produce  too much of the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone helps control the amount of  salt retained by the kidneys. Excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain  more salt than normal, which in turn increases the body's fluid levels and blood  pressure. People with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood  pressure (hypertension), often early in life. Without treatment, hypertension  increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure. html:p Familial hyperaldosteronism is categorized into three types, distinguished by  their clinical features and genetic causes. In familial hyperaldosteronism type  I, hypertension generally appears in childhood to early adulthood and can range  from mild to severe. This type can be treated with steroid medications called  glucocorticoids, so it is also known as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism  (GRA). In familial hyperaldosteronism type II, hypertension usually appears in  early to middle adulthood and does not improve with glucocorticoid treatment. In  most individuals with familial hyperaldosteronism type III, the adrenal glands  are enlarged up to six times their normal size. These affected individuals have  severe hypertension that starts in childhood. The hypertension is difficult to  treat and often results in damage to organs such as the heart and kidneys.  Rarely, individuals with type III have milder symptoms with treatable  hypertension and no adrenal gland enlargement. html:p There are other forms of hyperaldosteronism that are not familial. These  conditions are caused by various problems in the adrenal glands or kidneys. In  some cases, a cause for the increase in aldosterone levels cannot be found.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a disorder that impairs the body's</span>  ability to absorb and transport fats. This condition is characterized by low  levels of a fat-like substance called cholesterol in the blood. The severity of  signs and symptoms experienced by people with FHBL vary widely. The most mildly  affected individuals have few problems with absorbing fats from the diet and no  related signs and symptoms. Many individuals with FHBL develop an abnormal  buildup of fats in the liver called hepatic steatosis or fatty liver. In more  severely affected individuals, fatty liver may progress to chronic liver disease  (cirrhosis). Individuals with severe FHBL have greater difficulty absorbing  fats as well as fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin A. This  difficulty in fat absorption leads to excess fat in the feces (steatorrhea). In  childhood, these digestive problems can result in an inability to grow or gain  weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive).

Description1: html:p Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (FIBGC, formerly known as Fahr  disease) is a condition characterized by abnormal deposits of calcium  (calcification) in the brain. These calcium deposits typically occur in the  basal ganglia, which are structures deep within the brain that help start and  control movement; however, other brain regions can also be affected. html:p The signs and symptoms of FIBGC include movement disorders and  or  difficulties.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-isolated-hyperparathyroidism
frequency1: The prevalence of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism is unknown.
Description1: html:p Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism is an inherited condition characterized by  overactivity of the parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism). The four  parathyroid glands are located in the neck, and they release a hormone called  parathyroid hormone that regulates the amount of calcium in the blood. In  familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, one or more overactive parathyroid glands  release excess parathyroid hormone, which causes the levels of calcium in the  blood to rise (hypercalcemia). Parathyroid hormone stimulates the removal of  calcium from bone and the absorption of calcium from the diet, and the mineral  is then released into the bloodstream. html:p In people with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, the production of excess  parathyroid hormone is caused by tumors that involve the parathyroid glands.  Typically only one of the four parathyroid glands is affected, but in some  people, more than one gland develops a tumor. The tumors are usually  noncancerous (benign), in which case they are called adenomas. Rarely, people  with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism develop a cancerous tumor called  parathyroid carcinoma. Because the production of excess parathyroid hormone is  caused by abnormalities of the parathyroid glands, familial isolated  hyperparathyroidism is considered a form of primary hyperparathyroidism. html:p Disruption of the normal calcium balance resulting from overactive parathyroid  glands causes many of the common signs and symptoms of familial isolated  hyperparathyroidism, such as kidney stones, nausea, vomiting, high blood  pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. Because calcium is removed from  bones to be released into the bloodstream, hyperparathyroidism often causes  thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). The age at which familial isolated  hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed varies from childhood to adulthood. Often, the  first indication of the condition is elevated calcium levels identified through  a routine blood test, even though the affected individual may not yet have signs  or symptoms of hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

Name1: Familial isolated pituitary adenoma
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-isolated-pituitary-adenoma
frequency1: Pituitary adenomas, including sporadic tumors, are relatively common; they are identified in an estimated 1 in 1,000 people. FIPA, though, is quite rare, accounting for approximately 2 percent of pituitary adenomas. More than 200 families with FIPA have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) is an inherited condition  characterized by  . The pituitary gland, which is found at the base of  the brain, produces hormones that control many important body functions. html:p Tumors that form in the pituitary gland can release excess levels of one or more  hormones, although some tumors do not produce hormones (nonfunctioning  pituitary adenomas). Those that do are typically distinguished by the particular  hormones they produce. Prolactinomas are the most common tumors in FIPA. These  tumors release prolactin, a hormone that stimulates breast milk production in  females. Both women and men can develop prolactinomas, although they are more  common in women. In women, these tumors may lead to changes in the menstrual  cycle or difficulty becoming pregnant. Some affected women may produce breast  milk, even though they are not pregnant or nursing. In men, prolactinomas may  cause erectile dysfunction or decreased interest in sex. Rarely, affected men  produce breast milk. Large prolactinomas can press on nearby tissues such as the  nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (the optic nerves),  causing problems with vision. html:p Another type of tumor called somatotropinoma is also common in FIPA. These  tumors release growth hormone (also called somatotropin), which promotes growth  of the body. Somatotropinomas in children or adolescents can lead to increased  height (gigantism), because the long bones of their arms and legs are still  growing. In adults, growth of the long bones has stopped, but the tumors can  cause overgrowth of the hands, feet, and face (acromegaly) as well as other  tissues. html:p Less common tumor types in FIPA include somatolactotropinomas, nonfunctioning  pituitary adenomas, adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting tumors (which cause a  condition known as Cushing disease), thyrotropinomas, and gonadotropinomas. In a  family with the condition, affected members can develop the same type of tumor  (homogenous FIPA) or different types (heterogenous FIPA). html:p In FIPA, pituitary tumors usually occur at a younger age than sporadic pituitary  adenomas, which are not inherited. In general, FIPA tumors are also larger than  sporadic pituitary tumors. Often, people with FIPA have macroadenomas, which  are tumors larger than 10 millimeters. html:p Familial pituitary adenomas can occur as one of many features in other inherited  conditions such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Carney complex;  however, in FIPA, the pituitary adenomas are described as isolated because only  the pituitary gland is affected.

frequency1: This condition affects about 1 per million people worldwide. It is much more common in certain areas of the province of Quebec, Canada.
Description1: html:p Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is an inherited condition that disrupts  the normal breakdown of fats in the body, resulting in an increase of certain  kinds of fats. html:p People with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency typically develop signs and  symptoms before age 10, with one-quarter showing symptoms by age 1. The first  symptom of this condition is usually abdominal pain, which can vary from mild to  severe. The abdominal pain is often due to inflammation of the pancreas  (pancreatitis). These episodes of pancreatitis begin as sudden (acute) attacks.  If left untreated, pancreatitis can develop into a chronic condition that can  damage the pancreas and, in rare cases, be life-threatening. html:p Affected individuals may also have an enlarged liver and spleen  (hepatosplenomegaly). The higher the levels of fat in the body, the larger the  liver and spleen become. As fat levels rise, certain white blood cells called  macrophages take in excess fat in an attempt to rid fat from the bloodstream.  After taking in fat, the macrophages travel to the liver and spleen, where the  fatty cells accumulate. html:p Approximately half of individuals with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency  develop small yellow deposits of fat under the skin called eruptive xanthomas.  These fat deposits most commonly appear on the trunk, buttocks, knees, and arms.  Eruptive xanthomas are small (about 1 millimeter in diameter), but individual  xanthomas can cluster together to form larger patches. They are generally not  painful unless exposed to repeated friction or abrasion. Eruptive xanthomas  begin to appear when fat intake increases and levels rise; the deposits  disappear when fat intake slows and levels decrease. html:p The blood of people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency can have a milky  appearance due to its high fat content. When fat levels get very high in people  with this condition, fats can accumulate in blood vessels in the tissue that  lines the back of the eye (the retina). The fat buildup gives this tissue a pale  pink appearance when examined (lipemia retinalis). This fat accumulation does  not affect vision and will disappear once fats from the diet are reduced and  levels in the body decrease. html:p In people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency, increased fat levels can  also cause neurological features, such as , memory loss, and mild  decline (dementia). These problems are remedied when dietary fat  levels normalize.

Name1: Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-paroxysmal-kinesigenic-dyskinesia
frequency1: Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is estimated to occur in 1 in 150,000 individuals. For unknown reasons, this condition affects more males than females.
Description1: html:p Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by  episodes of abnormal movement that range from mild to severe. In the condition  name, the word paroxysmal indicates that the abnormal movements come and go over  time, kinesigenic means that episodes are triggered by movement, and dyskinesia  refers to involuntary movement of the body. html:p People with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia experience episodes of  irregular jerking or  movements that are induced by sudden motion, such  as standing up quickly or being startled. An episode may involve slow, prolonged  ; small, fast,"dance-like"motions (chorea);  writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis); or, rarely, flailing movements of  the limbs (ballismus). Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia may affect one  or both sides of the body. The type of abnormal movement varies among affected  individuals, even among members of the same family. In many people with familial  paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, a pattern of symptoms called an aura  immediately precedes the episode. The aura is often described as a crawling or  tingling sensation in the affected body part. Individuals with this condition do  not lose consciousness during an episode and do not experience any symptoms  between episodes. html:p Individuals with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia usually begin to  show signs and symptoms of the disorder during childhood or adolescence.  Episodes typically last less than five minutes, and the frequency of episodes  ranges from one per month to 100 per day. In most affected individuals, episodes  occur less often with age. html:p In some people with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia the disorder  begins in infancy with recurring  called benign infantile convulsions.  These  usually develop in the first year of life and stop by age 3. When  benign infantile convulsions are associated with familial paroxysmal  kinesigenic dyskinesia, the condition is known as infantile convulsions and  choreoathetosis (ICCA). In families with ICCA, some individuals develop only  benign infantile convulsions, some have only familial paroxysmal kinesigenic  dyskinesia, and others develop both.

Description1: html:p Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia is a disorder of the nervous  system that causes episodes of involuntary movement. Paroxysmal indicates that  the abnormal movements come and go over time. Nonkinesigenic means that episodes  are not triggered by sudden movement. Dyskinesia broadly refers to involuntary  movement of the body. html:p People with familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia experience episodes of  abnormal movement that are brought on by alcohol, caffeine, stress, fatigue,  menses, or excitement or develop without a known cause. Episodes are not induced  by exercise or sudden movement and do not occur during sleep. An episode is  characterized by irregular, jerking or  movements that range from mild to  severe. In this disorder, the dyskinesia can include slow, prolonged  ; small, fast,"dance-like"motions (chorea);  writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis); and, rarely, flailing movements of  the limbs (ballismus). The dyskinesia also affects muscles in the torso and  face. The type of abnormal movement varies among affected individuals, even  among affected members of the same family. Individuals with familial paroxysmal  nonkinesigenic dyskinesia do not lose consciousness during an episode. Most  people do not experience any neurological symptoms between episodes. html:p Individuals with familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia usually begin to  show signs and symptoms of the disorder during childhood or their early teens.  Episodes typically last 1 to 4 hours, and the frequency of episodes ranges from  several per day to one per year. In some affected individuals, episodes occur  less often with age.

Name1: Familial partial lipodystrophy
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-partial-lipodystrophy
frequency1: Familial partial lipodystrophy is a rare disease, affecting an estimated 1 in 1 million people overall. Type 2 is the most common form, with more than 500 cases reported in the medical literature. Women tend to be diagnosed with familial partial lipodystrophy more often than men, probably because a loss of fat from the hips and limbs is more easily recognized in women, and complications such as diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia occur more commonly in women.
Description1: html:p Familial partial lipodystrophy is a rare condition characterized by an abnormal  distribution of fatty (adipose) tissue. Adipose tissue is normally found in many  parts of the body, including beneath the skin and surrounding the internal  organs. It stores fat as a source of energy and also provides cushioning. In  people with familial partial lipodystrophy, adipose tissue is lost from the  arms, legs, and hips, giving these parts of the body a very muscular appearance.  The fat that cannot be stored in the limbs builds up around the face and neck,  and inside the abdomen. Excess fat in these areas gives individuals an  appearance described as"cushingoid,"because it resembles the physical features  associated with a hormonal disorder called Cushing disease. This abnormal fat  distribution can begin anytime from childhood to adulthood. html:p Abnormal storage of fat in the body can lead to health problems in adulthood.  Many people with familial partial lipodystrophy develop insulin resistance, a  condition in which the body's tissues cannot adequately respond to insulin,  which is a hormone that normally helps to regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin  resistance may worsen to become a more serious disease called diabetes mellitus.  Some people with familial partial lipodystrophy develop acanthosis nigricans, a  skin condition related to high levels of insulin in the bloodstream. Acanthosis  nigricans causes the skin in body folds and creases to become thick, dark, and  velvety. html:p Most people with familial partial lipodystrophy also have high levels of fats  called triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia),  which can lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Familial partial  lipodystrophy can also cause an abnormal buildup of fats in the liver (hepatic  steatosis), which can result in an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and abnormal  liver function. After puberty, some affected females develop multiple cysts on  the ovaries, an increased amount of body hair (hirsutism), and an inability to  conceive (infertility), which are likely related to hormonal changes. html:p Researchers have described at least six forms of familial partial lipodystrophy,  which are distinguished by their genetic cause. The most common form of  familial partial lipodystrophy is type 2, also called Dunnigan disease. In  addition to the signs and symptoms described above, some people with this type  of the disorder develop muscle weakness (myopathy), abnormalities of the heart  muscle (cardiomyopathy), a form of heart disease called coronary artery disease,  and problems with the electrical system that coordinates the heartbeat (the  conduction system).

Description1: html:p Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare genetic condition that affects the  skin. The name of the condition reflects its major features: The term  "pityriasis"refers to scaling;"rubra"means redness; and"pilaris"suggests  the involvement of hair follicles in this disorder. Affected individuals have a  salmon-colored skin rash covered in fine scales. This rash occurs in patches all  over the body, with distinct areas of unaffected skin between the patches.  Affected individuals also develop bumps called follicular keratoses that occur  around hair follicles. The skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet  often becomes thick, hard, and callused, a condition known as palmoplantar  keratoderma. html:p Researchers have distinguished six types of pityriasis rubra pilaris based on  the features of the disorder and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. The  familial form is usually considered part of type V, which is also known as the  atypical juvenile type. People with familial pityriasis rubra pilaris typically  have skin abnormalities from birth or early childhood, and these skin problems  persist throughout life.

Name1: Familial restrictive cardiomyopathy
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-restrictive-cardiomyopathy
frequency1: The prevalence of familial restrictive cardiomyopathy is unknown. Although cardiomyopathy is a relatively common condition, restrictive cardiomyopathy, in which relaxation of the heart muscle is impaired, is the least common type. Some other forms of cardiomyopathy involve a weak or enlarged heart muscle with <span style="background:#FFFF00;">impaired contraction. In the United States and in Europe, restrictive</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">cardiomyopathy accounts for less than five percent of all cardiomyopathies. The</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">proportion of restrictive cardiomyopathy that runs in families is not known.</span>
Description1: html:p Familial restrictive cardiomyopathy is a genetic form of heart disease. For the  heart to beat normally, the heart (cardiac) muscle must contract and relax in a  coordinated way. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs travels first through the  upper chambers of the heart (the atria), and then to the lower chambers of the  heart (the ventricles). html:p In people with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is stiff  and cannot fully relax after each contraction. Impaired muscle relaxation causes  blood to back up in the atria and lungs, which reduces the amount of blood in  the ventricles. html:p Familial restrictive cardiomyopathy can appear anytime from childhood to  adulthood. The first signs and symptoms of this condition in children are  failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive),  extreme tiredness (fatigue), and fainting. Children who are severely affected  may also have abnormal swelling or puffiness (edema), increased blood pressure,  an enlarged liver, an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity  (ascites), and lung congestion. Some children with familial restrictive  cardiomyopathy do not have any obvious signs or symptoms, but they may die  suddenly due to heart failure. Without treatment, the majority of affected  children survive only a few years after they are diagnosed. html:p Adults with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy typically first develop  shortness of breath, fatigue, and a reduced ability to exercise. Some  individuals have an irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) and may also experience a  sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations) and dizziness.  Abnormal blood clots are commonly seen in adults with this condition. Without  treatment, approximately one-third of adults with familial restrictive  cardiomyopathy do not survive more than five years after diagnosis.

Ruptured</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">aortic aneurysms and dissections are estimated to cause almost 30,000 deaths in</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">the United States each year.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves</span>  problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood  from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of  the aorta, near the heart. This part of the aorta is called the thoracic aorta  because it is located in the chest (thorax). Other vessels that carry blood from  the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) can also be affected. html:p In familial TAAD, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic  dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm).  Aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta  wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers.  These aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can  decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital  organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture). html:p The occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the  same affected family. They can begin in childhood or not occur until late in  life. Aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial TAAD to  develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or  no aortic dilatation. html:p Aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. However, depending on the size,  growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the  jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or  painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough;  or coughing up blood. Aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or  back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint  pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis. html:p Familial TAAD may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. However, some  individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions  called Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. These features include  , stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement  (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest. Occasionally,  people with familial TAAD develop aneurysms in the brain or in the section of  the aorta located in the abdomen (abdominal aorta). Some people with familial  TAAD have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). Affected  individuals may also have a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (inguinal  hernia), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or a purplish skin  discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood  vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries). However, these conditions are also  common in the general population. Depending on the genetic cause of familial  TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing  blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.

frequency1: Fanconi anemia occurs in 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is more common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the Roma population of Spain, and black South Africans.
Description1: html:p Fanconi anemia is a condition that affects many parts of the body. People with  this condition may have bone marrow failure, physical abnormalities, organ  defects, and an increased risk of certain cancers. html:p The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. These include  red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues; white blood cells,  which fight infections; and platelets, which are necessary for normal blood  clotting. Approximately 90 percent of people with Fanconi anemia have impaired  bone marrow function that leads to a decrease in the production of all blood  cells (aplastic anemia). Affected individuals experience extreme tiredness  (fatigue) due to low numbers of red blood cells (anemia), frequent infections  due to low numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), and clotting problems due  to low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia). People with Fanconi anemia may  also develop myelodysplastic syndrome, a condition in which immature blood cells  fail to develop normally. html:p More than half of people with Fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities. These  abnormalities can involve irregular skin coloring such as unusually  light-colored skin (hypopigmentation) or café-au-lait spots, which are flat  patches on the skin that are darker than the surrounding area. Other possible  symptoms of Fanconi anemia include malformed thumbs or forearms and other  skeletal problems including ; malformed or absent kidneys and other  defects of the urinary tract; gastrointestinal abnormalities; s;  eye abnormalities such as small or abnormally shaped eyes; and malformed ears  and hearing loss. People with this condition may have abnormal or  malformations of the reproductive system. As a result, most affected males and  about half of affected females cannot have biological children (are infertile).  Additional signs and symptoms can include abnormalities of the brain and spinal  cord (central nervous system), including increased fluid in the center of the  brain (hydrocephalus) or an unusually small head size (microcephaly). html:p Individuals with Fanconi anemia have an increased risk of developing a cancer of  blood-forming cells in the bone marrow called acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or  tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The  likelihood of developing one of these cancers in people with Fanconi anemia is  between 10 and 30 percent.

Description1: html:p Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN) is a progressive  disorder of the nervous system (neurodegeneration) characterized by problems  with movement and vision that begin during childhood or adolescence. html:p Changes in the way a person walks (gait) and frequent falls are usually the  first noticeable signs of FAHN. Affected individuals gradually develop extreme  and exaggerated reflexes. They typically have  Involuntary , problems with  , or both. The movement problems worsen over time, and some people with  this condition eventually require wheelchair assistance. html:p People with FAHN often develop vision problems, which occur due to deterioration  (atrophy) of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (the  optic nerves) and difficulties with the muscles that control eye movement.  Affected individuals may have a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity),  decreased field of vision, impaired color perception, eyes that do not look in  the same direction (strabismus), rapid involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), or  difficulty moving the eyes intentionally (supranuclear gaze palsy). html:p impairment () also occurs in FAHN, and severely affected  individuals may lose the ability to speak. People with this disorder may also  have difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia). In severe cases, they may  develop malnutrition and require a feeding tube. The swallowing difficulties  can lead to a bacterial lung infection called aspiration pneumonia, which can be  life-threatening. As the disorder progresses, some affected individuals  experience  and a decline in  function. html:p Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in people with FAHN shows signs of  iron accumulation, especially in an area of the brain called the globus  pallidus, which is involved in regulating movement. Similar patterns of iron  accumulation are seen in certain other neurological disorders such as infantile  neuroaxonal dystrophy and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. All  these conditions belong to a class of disorders called neurodegeneration with  brain iron accumulation (NBIA).

Affected individuals have shortened long bones in the  arms and legs that are unusually wide at the ends (described as  dumbbell-shaped). People with this condition also have a narrow chest with  short, wide ribs and a round and prominent abdomen. The bones of the spine  (vertebrae) are flattened (platyspondyly) and have a characteristic pinched or  pear shape that is noticeable on x-rays. Other skeletal abnormalities associated  with fibrochondrogenesis include abnormal curvature of the spine and  underdeveloped hip (pelvic) bones. html:p People with fibrochondrogenesis also have distinctive facial features. These  include prominent eyes, low-set ears, a small mouth with a long upper lip, and a  small chin (micrognathia). Affected individuals have a relatively  flat-appearing midface, particularly a small nose with a flat nasal bridge and  nostrils that open to the front rather than downward (anteverted nares). Vision  problems, including severe nearsightedness (high myopia) and clouding of the  lens of the eye (cataract), are common in those who survive infancy. Most  affected individuals also have sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by  abnormalities of the inner ear.

Description1: html:p Floating-Harbor syndrome is a disorder involving , slowing of the  mineralization of the bones (delayed bone age), , and  characteristic facial features. The condition is named for the hospitals where  it was first described, the Boston Floating Hospital and Harbor General Hospital  in Torrance, California. html:p in people with Floating-Harbor syndrome generally becomes  apparent in the first year of life, and affected individuals are usually among  the shortest 5 percent of their age group. Bone age is delayed in early  childhood; for example, an affected 3-year-old child may have bones more typical  of a child of 2. However, bone age is usually normal by age 6 to 12. html:p may be severe in  Floating-Harbor syndrome, and  impairment can lead to problems in verbal  . Most affected individuals also have mild    similar to that of other children their age. html:p Typical facial features in people with Floating-Harbor syndrome include a  triangular face; a low hairline; deep-set eyes; long eyelashes; a large,  distinctive nose with a low-hanging separation (overhanging columella) between  large nostrils; a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short  philtrum); and thin lips. As affected children grow and mature, the nose becomes  more prominent. html:p Additional features that have occurred in some affected individuals include  short fingers and toes (brachydactyly); widened and rounded tips of the fingers  (clubbing); curved pinky fingers (fifth finger clinodactyly); an unusually  high-pitched voice; and, in males, undescended testes (cryptorchidism).

frequency1: Focal dermal hypoplasia appears to be a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Focal dermal hypoplasia is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the skin,  skeleton, eyes, and face. About 90 percent of affected individuals are female.  Males usually have milder signs and symptoms than females. Although intelligence  is typically unaffected, some individuals have  disability. html:p People with focal dermal hypoplasia have skin abnormalities present from birth,  such as streaks of very thin skin (dermal hypoplasia), yellowish-pink nodules of  fat under the skin, areas where the top layers of skin are absent (cutis  aplasia), small clusters of veins on the surface of the skin (telangiectases),  and streaks of slightly darker or lighter skin. These skin changes may cause  pain, itching, irritation, or lead to skin infections. Wart-like growths called  papillomas are usually not present at birth but develop with age. Papillomas  typically form around the nostrils, lips, anus, and female genitalia. They may  also be present in the throat, specifically in the esophagus or larynx, and can  cause problems with swallowing, breathing, or sleeping. Papillomas can usually  be surgically removed if necessary. Affected individuals may have small, ridged  fingernails and toenails. Hair on the scalp can be sparse and brittle or absent. html:p Many individuals with have hand and foot abnormalities,  including missing fingers or toes (oligodactyly), webbed or fused fingers or  toes (syndactyly), and a deep split in the hands or feet with missing fingers or  toes and fusion of the remaining digits (ectrodactyly). X-rays can show streaks  of altered bone density, called osteopathia striata, that do not cause any  symptoms in people with . html:p Eye abnormalities are common in individuals with  including small eyes (microphthalmia), absent or severely underdeveloped eyes  (anophthalmia), and problems with the tear ducts. Affected individuals may also  have incomplete development of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye  (retina) or the nerve that relays visual information from the eye to the brain  (optic nerve). This abnormal development of the retina and optic nerve can  result in a gap or split in these structures, which is called a coloboma. Some  of these eye abnormalities do not impair vision, while others can lead to low  vision or blindness. html:p People with  may have distinctive facial features.  Affected individuals often have a pointed chin, small ears, notched nostrils,  and a slight difference in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the  face (facial asymmetry). These facial characteristics are typically very  subtle. An opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof  of the mouth (cleft palate) may also be present. html:p About half of individuals with  have abnormalities of  their teeth, especially the hard, white material that forms the protective outer  layer of each tooth (enamel). Less commonly, abnormalities of the kidneys and  gastrointestinal system are present. The kidneys may be fused together, which  predisposes affected individuals to kidney infections but does not typically  cause significant health problems. The main gastrointestinal abnormality that  occurs in people with  is an omphalocele, which is an  opening in the wall of the abdomen that allows the abdominal organs to protrude  through the navel. The signs and symptoms of vary  widely, although almost all affected individuals have skin abnormalities.

FXPOI accounts for</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">about 4 to 6 percent of all cases of primary ovarian insufficiency in women.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is a condition that</span>  affects women and is characterized by reduced function of the ovaries. The  ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced. As a  form of primary ovarian insufficiency, FXPOI can cause irregular menstrual  cycles, early menopause, an inability to have children (infertility), and  elevated levels of a hormone known as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is  produced in both males and females and helps regulate the development of  reproductive cells (eggs in females and sperm in males). In females, the level  of FSH rises and falls, but overall it increases as a woman ages. In younger  women, elevated levels may indicate early menopause and fertility problems. html:p The severity of FXPOI is variable. The most severely affected women have overt  POI (formerly called premature ovarian failure). These women have irregular or  absent menstrual periods and elevated FSH levels before age 40. Overt POI often  causes infertility. Other women have occult POI; they have normal menstrual  periods but reduced fertility, and they may have elevated levels of FSH (in  which case, it is called biochemical POI). The reduction in ovarian function  caused by FXPOI results in low levels of the hormone estrogen, which leads to  many of the common signs and symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes,  insomnia, and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). Women with FXPOI undergo  menopause an average of 5 years earlier than women without the condition.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Fragile X-associated /ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is characterized by problems</span>  with movement and thinking ability (cognition). FXTAS is a late-onset disorder,  usually occurring after age 50, and its signs and symptoms worsen with age.  This condition affects males more frequently and severely than females. Affected  individuals have areas of damage in the part of the brain that controls  movement (the cerebellum) and in a type of brain tissue known as white matter,  which can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This damage leads to  the movement problems and other impairments associated with FXTAS. html:p The characteristic features of FXTAS are , which is  or  when trying to perform a voluntary movement such as reaching  for an object, and problems with . Typically  s will develop first, followed a few years later by ataxia,  although not everyone with FXTAS has both features. Many affected individuals  develop other movement problems, such as a pattern of movement abnormalities  known as parkinsonism, which includes s when not moving (resting ),  rigidity, and unusually slow movement (bradykinesia). In addition, affected  individuals may have reduced sensation, numbness or tingling, pain, or muscle  weakness in the lower limbs. Some people with FXTAS experience problems with the  autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions, leading to  the inability to control the bladder or bowel. html:p People with FXTAS commonly have cognitive disabilities. They may develop  short-term memory loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to  plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies. Loss of this  function impairs skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, focusing  attention appropriately, and cognitive flexibility. Many people with FXTAS  experience , , moodiness, or irritability. html:p Some women develop immune system disorders, such as hypothyroidism or  fibromyalgia, before the signs and symptoms of FXTAS appear.

frequency1: Friedreich ataxia is estimated to affect 1 in 40,000 people in the United States. This condition is found in people with European, Middle Eastern, or North African ancestry. It is rarely identified in other ethnic groups.
Description1: html:p Friedreich ataxia is a genetic condition that affects the nervous system and  causes movement problems. People with this condition develop impaired muscle  that worsens over time. Other features of this condition  include the gradual loss of strength and sensation in the arms and legs;  ; and impaired , hearing, and vision. Individuals  with Friedreich ataxia often have a form of heart disease called hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy, which enlarges and weakens the heart muscle and can be  life-threatening. Some affected individuals develop diabetes or an abnormal  curvature of the spine (scoliosis). html:p Most people with Friedreich ataxia begin to experience the signs and symptoms of  the disorder between ages 5 and 15. Poor coordination and balance are often the  first noticeable features. Affected individuals typically require the use of a  wheelchair about 10 years after signs and symptoms appear. html:p About 25 percent of people with Friedreich ataxia have an atypical form in which  signs and symptoms begin after age 25. Affected individuals who develop  Friedreich ataxia between ages 26 and 39 are considered to have late-onset  Friedreich ataxia (LOFA). When the signs and symptoms begin after age 40 the  condition is called very late-onset Friedreich ataxia (VLOFA). LOFA and VLOFA  usually progress more slowly than typical Friedreich ataxia.

Description1: html:p Frontonasal dysplasia is a condition that results from abnormal development of  the head and face before birth. People with frontonasal dysplasia have at least  two of the following features: widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); a  broad nose; a slit (cleft) in one or both sides of the nose; no nasal tip; a  central cleft involving the nose, upper lip, or roof of the mouth (palate);  incomplete formation of the front of the skull with skin covering the head where  bone should be (anterior cranium bifidum occultum); or a widow's peak hairline. html:p Other features of frontonasal dysplasia can include additional facial  malformations, absence or malformation of the tissue that connects the left and  right halves of the brain (the corpus callosum), and  disability. html:p There are at least three types of frontonasal dysplasia that are distinguished  by their genetic causes and their signs and symptoms. In addition to the  features previously described, each type of frontonasal dysplasia is associated  with other distinctive features. Individuals with frontonasal dysplasia type 1  typically have abnormalities of the nose, a long area between the nose and upper  lip (philtrum), and droopy upper eyelids (ptosis).

However, the disorder is likely underdiagnosed, so it may actually be more common than this estimate.FTDP-17 probably accounts for a small percentage of all cases of frontotemporal dementia.
Description1: html:p Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17) is a brain disorder. It  is part of a group of conditions, called frontotemporal dementia or  frontotemporal degeneration, that are characterized by a loss of nerve cells  (neurons) in areas of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes. Over  time, a loss of these cells can affect personality, behavior, , and  movement. html:p The signs and symptoms of FTDP-17 usually become noticeable in a person's  forties or fifties. Most affected people survive 5 to 10 years after the  appearance of symptoms, although a few have survived for two decades or more. html:p Changes in personality and behavior are often early signs of FTDP-17. These  changes include a loss of inhibition, inappropriate emotional responses,  restlessness, neglect of personal hygiene, and a general loss of interest in  activities and events. The disease also leads to deterioration of cognitive  functions (dementia), including problems with judgment, planning, and  concentration. Some people with FTDP-17 develop  symptoms, including  obsessive-compulsive behaviors, strongly held false beliefs (delusions), and  false perceptions (hallucinations). It may become difficult for affected  individuals to interact with others in a ly appropriate manner. They  increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily  living. html:p Many people with FTDP-17 develop problems with  and . They may  have trouble finding words, confuse one word with another (semantic  paraphasias), and repeat words spoken by others (echolalia). Difficulties with  and  worsen over time, and most affected individuals eventually  lose the ability to communicate. html:p FTDP-17 is also characterized by problems with movement that worsen over time.  Many affected individuals develop features of parkinsonism, including s,  rigidity, and unusually slow movement (bradykinesia). As the disease progresses,  most affected individuals become unable to walk. Some people with FTDP-17 also  have restricted up-and-down eye movement (vertical gaze palsy) and rapid  abnormal movements of both eyes (saccades).

Name1: Galactosemia
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/galactosemia
frequency1: Classic galactosemia occurs in 1 in 30,000 to 60,000 newborns. Galactosemia type II and type III are less common; type II probably affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 newborns and type III appears to be very rare.
Description1: html:p Galactosemia is a disorder that affects how the body processes a simple sugar  called galactose. A small amount of galactose is present in many foods. It is  primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy  products and many baby formulas. The signs and symptoms of galactosemia result  from an inability to use galactose to produce energy. html:p Researchers have identified several types of galactosemia. These conditions are  each caused by mutations in a particular gene and affect different enzymes  involved in breaking down galactose. html:p Classic galactosemia, also known as type I, is the most common and most severe  form of the condition. If infants with classic galactosemia are not treated  promptly with a low-galactose diet, life-threatening complications appear within  a few days after birth. Affected infants typically develop feeding  difficulties, a lack of energy (lethargy), a failure to gain weight and grow as  expected (failure to thrive), yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes  (jaundice), liver damage, and abnormal bleeding. Other serious complications of  this condition can include overwhelming bacterial infections (sepsis) and shock.  Affected children are also at increased risk of , clouding  of the lens of the eye (cataract),  difficulties, and  disability. Females with classic galactosemia may develop reproductive problems  caused by an early loss of function of the ovaries (premature ovarian  insufficiency). html:p Galactosemia type II (also called galactokinase deficiency) and type III (also  called galactose epimerase deficiency) cause different patterns of signs and  symptoms. Galactosemia type II causes fewer medical problems than the classic  type. Affected infants develop cataracts but otherwise experience few long-term  complications. The signs and symptoms of galactosemia type III vary from mild to  severe and can include cataracts,  , liver disease, and kidney problems.

Most people with this type of the condition are of</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Japanese descent.</span>
Description1: html:p Galactosialidosis is a condition that affects many areas of the body. The three  forms of galactosialidosis are distinguished by the age at which symptoms  develop and the pattern of features. html:p The early infantile form of galactosialidosis is associated with extensive  swelling caused by fluid accumulation before birth (hydrops fetalis), a soft  out-pouching in the lower abdomen (an inguinal hernia), and an enlarged liver  and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Additional features of this form include  and distinctive facial features  that are often described as"coarse."Some infants have an enlarged heart  (cardiomegaly); an eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be  identified with an eye examination; and kidney disease that can progress to  kidney failure. Infants with this form usually are diagnosed between birth and  3 months; they typically live into late infancy. html:p The late infantile form of galactosialidosis shares some features with the early  infantile form, although the signs and symptoms are somewhat less severe and  begin later in infancy. This form is characterized by , dysostosis  multiplex, heart valve problems, hepatosplenomegaly, and"coarse"facial  features. Other symptoms seen in some individuals with this type include  disability, hearing loss, and a cherry-red spot. Children with  this condition typically develop symptoms within the first year of life. The  life expectancy of individuals with this type varies depending on the severity  of symptoms. html:p The juvenile/adult form of galactosialidosis has signs and symptoms that are  somewhat different than those of the other two types. This form is  distinguished by difficulty s , muscle twitches  (myoclonus), , and progressive  disability. People with  this form typically also have dark red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas),  abnormalities in the bones of the spine,"coarse"facial features, a cherry-red  spot, vision loss, and hearing loss. The age at which symptoms begin to develop  varies widely among affected individuals, but the average age is 16. This form  is typically associated with a normal life expectancy.

The  tumors are thought to grow from specialized cells found in the gastrointestinal  tract called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or precursors to these cells.  GISTs are usually found in adults between ages 40 and 70; rarely, children and  young adults develop these tumors. The tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or  noncancerous (benign). html:p Small tumors may cause no signs or symptoms. However, some people with GISTs may  experience pain or swelling in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,  or weight loss. Sometimes, tumors cause bleeding, which may lead to low red  blood cell counts (anemia) and, consequently, weakness and tiredness. Bleeding  into the intestinal tract may cause black and tarry stools, and bleeding into  the throat or stomach may cause vomiting of blood. html:p Affected individuals with no family history of GIST typically have only one  tumor (called a sporadic GIST). People with a family history of GISTs (called  familial GISTs) often have multiple tumors and additional signs or symptoms,  including noncancerous overgrowth (hyperplasia) of other cells in the  gastrointestinal tract and patches of dark skin on various areas of the body.  Some affected individuals have a skin condition called urticaria pigmentosa  (also known as cutaneous mastocytosis), which is characterized by raised patches  of brownish skin that sting or itch when touched.

Description1: html:p Gaucher disease is an inherited disorder that affects many of the body's organs  and tissues. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely among  affected individuals. Researchers have described several types of Gaucher  disease based on their characteristic features. html:p Type 1 Gaucher disease is the most common form of this condition. Type 1 is  also called non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease because the brain and spinal cord  (the central nervous system) are usually not affected. The features of this  condition range from mild to severe and may appear anytime from childhood to  adulthood. Major signs and symptoms include enlargement of the liver and spleen  (hepatosplenomegaly), a low number of red blood cells (anemia), easy bruising  caused by a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), lung disease, and  bone abnormalities such as bone pain, fractures, and arthritis. html:p Types 2 and 3 Gaucher disease are known as neuronopathic forms of the disorder  because they are characterized by problems that affect the central nervous  system. In addition to the signs and symptoms described above, these conditions  can cause abnormal eye movements, , and brain damage. Type 2 Gaucher  disease usually causes life-threatening medical problems beginning in infancy.  Type 3 Gaucher disease also affects the nervous system, but it tends to worsen  more slowly than type 2. html:p The most severe type of Gaucher disease is called the perinatal lethal form.  This condition causes severe or life-threatening complications starting before  birth or in infancy. Features of the perinatal lethal form can include  extensive swelling caused by fluid accumulation before birth (hydrops fetalis);  dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis) or other skin abnormalities; hepatosplenomegaly;  distinctive facial features; and serious neurological problems. As its name  indicates, most infants with the perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease  survive for only a few days after birth. html:p Another form of Gaucher disease is known as the cardiovascular type because it  primarily affects the heart, causing the heart valves to harden (calcify).  People with the cardiovascular form of Gaucher disease may also have eye  abnormalities, bone disease, and mild enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly).

Name1: Geleophysic dysplasia
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/geleophysic-dysplasia
frequency1: Geleophysic dysplasia is a rare disorder whose prevalence is unknown. More than 30 affected individuals have been reported.
Description1: html:p Geleophysic dysplasia is an inherited condition that affects many parts of the  body. It is characterized by abnormalities involving the bones, heart,  and skin. html:p People with geleophysic dysplasia have  with very short hands and  feet. Most also develop thickened skin and  , both of which significantly limit mobility. Affected individuals  usually have a limited range of motion in their fingers, toes, wrists, and  elbows. Additionally,  cause many affected  people to walk on their toes. html:p The name of this condition, which comes from the Greek words for happy  ("gelios") and nature ("physis"), is derived from the good-natured facial  appearance seen in most affected individuals. The distinctive facial features  associated with this condition include a round face with full cheeks, a small  nose with upturned nostrils, a broad nasal bridge, a thin upper lip, upturned  corners of the mouth, and a flat area between the upper lip and the nose  (philtrum). html:p Geleophysic dysplasia is also characterized by heart (cardiac) problems,  particularly abnormalities of the cardiac valves. These valves normally control  the flow of blood through the heart. In people with geleophysic dysplasia, the  cardiac valves thicken, which impedes blood flow and increases blood pressure in  the heart. Other heart problems have also been reported in people with  geleophysic dysplasia; these include a narrowing of the artery from the heart to  the lungs (pulmonary stenosis) and a hole between the two upper chambers of the  heart (atrial septal defect). html:p Other features of geleophysic dysplasia can include an enlarged liver  (hepatomegaly) and recurrent respiratory and ear infections. In severe cases, a  narrowing of the windpipe (tracheal stenosis) can cause serious breathing  problems. As a result of heart and respiratory abnormalities, geleophysic  dysplasia is often life-threatening in childhood. However, some affected people  have lived into adulthood.

frequency1: The prevalence of GACI has been estimated to be about 1 in 391,000. At least 200 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a disorder affecting the  circulatory system that becomes apparent before birth or within the first few  months of life. It is characterized by abnormal accumulation of the mineral  calcium (calcification) in the walls of the blood vessels that carry blood from  the heart to the rest of the body (the arteries). This calcification often  occurs along with thickening of the lining of the arterial walls (the intima).  These changes lead to narrowing (stenosis) and stiffness of the arteries, which  forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. As a result, heart failure may  develop in affected individuals, with signs and symptoms including difficulty  breathing, accumulation of fluid (edema) in the extremities, a bluish appearance  of the skin or lips (cyanosis), severe high blood pressure (hypertension), and  an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly). html:p People with GACI may also have calcification in other organs and tissues,  particularly around the joints. In addition, they may have hearing loss or  softening and weakening of the bones (rickets). html:p Some individuals with GACI also develop features similar to those of another  disorder called pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is characterized by the  accumulation of calcium and other minerals (mineralization) in elastic fibers,  which are a component of connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength  and flexibility to structures throughout the body. Features characteristic of  PXE that also occur in GACI include yellowish bumps called papules on the  underarms and other areas of skin that touch when a joint bends (flexor areas);  and abnormalities called angioid streaks affecting tissue at the back of the  eye, which can be detected during an eye examination. html:p As a result of the cardiovascular problems associated with GACI, individuals  with this condition often do not survive past infancy, with death typically  caused by a heart attack or stroke. However, affected individuals who survive  their first six months, known as the critical period, can live into adolescence  or early adulthood.

Description1: html:p Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe form of a skin disorder called  psoriasis. GPP and other forms of psoriasis are caused by abnormal inflammation.  Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders  (such as bacteria). However, when inflammation is abnormal and uncontrolled, it  can damage the body's tissues and organs. Individuals with GPP have repeated  episodes in which large areas of skin become red and inflamed and develop small  pus-filled blisters (pustules). The skin problems can be accompanied by fever,  extreme tiredness (fatigue), muscle weakness, an increased number of white blood  cells, and other signs of inflammation throughout the body (systemic  inflammation). The inflammation problems subside and reappear often. Episodes  can be triggered by infection, exposure to or withdrawal from certain  medications, menstruation, or pregnancy, although the trigger is often unknown.  GPP can be life-threatening if not treated. html:p While many affected individuals have features only of GPP (called GPP alone),  some develop features of another skin condition called psoriasis vulgaris (PV),  either before or after GPP appears. PV, the most common form of psoriasis, is  characterized by red, scaly patches of skin (plaques) on parts of the body.

Description1: html:p Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia is a rare inherited condition characterized by  abnormally thick bones and a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Signs and  symptoms of the condition become apparent in early childhood. html:p In affected individuals, the long bones in the arms and legs are unusually dense  and wide. The bone changes specifically affect the shafts of the long bones,  called diaphyses, and areas near the ends of the bones called metaphyses. The  bone abnormalities can lead to bowing of the legs and difficulty walking. html:p Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia also causes scarring (fibrosis) of the bone  marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside long bones where blood cells are  formed. The abnormal bone marrow cannot produce enough red blood cells, which  leads to anemia.Signs and symptoms of anemia that have been reported in people  with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia include extremely pale skin (pallor) and  excessive tiredness (fatigue).

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/giant-axonal-neuropathy
frequency1: Giant axonal neuropathy is a very rare disorder; only about 50 affected families have been described in the medical literature. The condition is thought to be under-diagnosed because its early symptoms resemble those of other, more common disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
Description1: html:p Giant axonal neuropathy is an inherited condition characterized by abnormally  large and dysfunctional axons called giant axons. Axons are specialized  extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit nerve impulses. Symptoms of  the disorder first become apparent in the peripheral nervous system, in which  long axons connect the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) to muscles  and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and  sound. However, axons in the central nervous system are affected as well. html:p The signs and symptoms of giant axonal neuropathy generally begin in early  childhood and get worse over time. Most affected individuals first have problems  with walking. Later they may lose sensation, strength, and reflexes in their  limbs; experience ; and require  wheelchair assistance. Visual and hearing problems may also occur. Many  individuals with this condition have extremely kinky hair as compared to others  in their family. html:p Giant axonal neuropathy can also impact the autonomic nervous system, which  controls involuntary body processes. Affected individuals may experience  problems with the release of urine (neurogenic bladder), constipation, heat  intolerance, and reduction in or loss of the ability to sweat. html:p As the disorder worsens, paralysis, , and a gradual decline in mental  function (dementia) can also occur. Most people with giant axonal neuropathy do  not survive past their twenties.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/giant-congenital-melanocytic-nevus
frequency1: Giant congenital melanocytic nevus occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 newborns worldwide.
Description1: html:p Giant congenital melanocytic nevus is a skin condition characterized by an  abnormally dark, noncancerous skin patch (nevus) that is composed of  pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It is present from birth  (congenital) or is noticeable soon after birth. The nevus may be small in  infants, but it will usually grow at the same rate the body grows and will  eventually be at least 40 cm (15.75 inches) across. The nevus can appear  anywhere on the body, but it is more often found on the trunk or limbs. The  color ranges from tan to black and can become darker or lighter over time. The  surface of a nevus can be flat, rough, raised, thickened, or bumpy; the surface  can vary in different regions of the nevus, and it can change over time. The  skin of the nevus is often dry and prone to irritation and itching (dermatitis).  Excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) can occur within the nevus. There is  often less fat tissue under the skin of the nevus; the skin may appear thinner  there than over other areas of the body. html:p People with giant congenital melanocytic nevus may have more than one nevus  (plural: nevi). The other nevi are often smaller than the giant nevus. Affected  individuals may have one or two additional nevi or multiple small nevi that are  scattered over the skin; these are known as satellite or disseminated nevi. html:p Affected individuals may feel  or emotional stress due to the impact the  nevus may have on their appearance and their health. Children with giant  congenital melanocytic nevus can develop emotional or behavior problems. html:p Some people with giant congenital melanocytic nevus develop a condition called  neurocutaneous melanosis, which is the presence of pigment-producing skin cells  (melanocytes) in the tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. These  melanocytes may be spread out or grouped together in clusters. Their growth can  cause increased pressure in the brain, leading to headache, vomiting,  irritability, , and movement problems. Tumors in the brain may also  develop. html:p Individuals with giant congenital melanocytic nevus have an increased risk of  developing an  form of cancer called melanoma, which arises from  melanocytes. Estimates vary, but it is generally thought that people with giant  congenital melanocytic nevus have a 5 to 10 percent lifetime risk of developing  melanoma. Melanoma commonly begins in the nevus, but it can develop when  melanocytes that invade other tissues, such as those in the brain and spinal  cord, become cancerous. When melanoma occurs in people with giant congenital  melanocytic nevus, the survival rate is low. html:p Other types of tumors can also develop in individuals with giant congenital  melanocytic nevus, including soft tissue tumors (sarcomas), fatty tumors  (lipomas), and tumors of the nerve cells (schwannomas).

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Gilbert syndrome is a relatively mild condition characterized by periods of</span>  elevated levels of a toxic substance called bilirubin in the blood  (hyperbilirubinemia). Bilirubin, which has an orange-yellow tint, is produced  when red blood cells are broken down. This substance is removed from the body  only after it undergoes a chemical reaction in the liver, which converts the  toxic form of bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) to a nontoxic form called  conjugated bilirubin. People with Gilbert syndrome have a buildup of  unconjugated bilirubin in their blood (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia). In  affected individuals, bilirubin levels fluctuate and very rarely increase to  levels that cause jaundice, which is yellowing of the skin and whites of the  eyes. html:p Gilbert syndrome is usually recognized in adolescence. If people with this  condition have episodes of hyperbilirubinemia, these episodes are generally mild  and typically occur when the body is under stress, for instance because of  dehydration, prolonged periods without food (fasting), illness, vigorous  exercise, or menstruation. Some people with Gilbert syndrome also experience  abdominal discomfort or tiredness. However, approximately 30 percent of people  with Gilbert syndrome have no signs or symptoms of the condition and are  discovered only when routine blood tests reveal elevated unconjugated bilirubin  levels.

frequency1: Glucose-galactose malabsorption is a rare disorder; only a few hundred cases have been identified worldwide. However, as many as 10 percent of the population may have a somewhat reduced capacity for glucose absorption without associated health problems. This condition may be a milder variation of glucose-galactose malabsorption.
Description1: html:p Glucose-galactose malabsorption is a condition in which the cells lining the  intestine cannot take in the sugars glucose and galactose, which prevents proper  digestion of these molecules and larger molecules made from them. html:p Glucose and galactose are called simple sugars, or monosaccharides. Sucrose  (table sugar) and lactose (the sugar found in milk) are called disaccharides  because they are made from two simple sugars, and are broken down into these  simple sugars during digestion. Sucrose is broken down into glucose and another  simple sugar called fructose, and lactose is broken down into glucose and  galactose. As a result, lactose, sucrose and other compounds made from sugar  molecules (carbohydrates) cannot be digested by individuals with  glucose-galactose malabsorption. html:p Glucose-galactose malabsorption generally becomes apparent in the first few  weeks of a baby's life. Affected infants experience severe diarrhea resulting in  life-threatening dehydration, increased acidity of the blood and tissues  (acidosis), and weight loss when fed breast milk or regular infant formulas.  However, they are able to digest fructose-based formulas that do not contain  glucose or galactose. Some affected children are better able to tolerate glucose  and galactose as they get older. html:p Small amounts of glucose in the urine (mild glucosuria) may occur intermittently  in this disorder.

frequency1: GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a rare disorder. Approximately 500 cases have been reported worldwide since the disorder was first identified in 1991. In Australia, the prevalence of the disorder has been estimated at 1 in 90,000 people. However, researchers suggest that the disorder may be underdiagnosed, because many neurological disorders can cause similar symptoms.
Description1: html:p GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a disorder affecting the nervous system that can  have a variety of neurological signs and symptoms. Approximately 90 percent of  affected individuals have a form of the disorder often referred to as common  GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. These individuals generally have frequent  () beginning in the first months of life. In newborns, the first sign of  the disorder may be involuntary eye movements that are rapid and irregular.  Babies with common GLUT1 deficiency syndrome have a normal head size at birth,  but growth of the brain and skull is often slow, which can result in an  abnormally small head size (microcephaly). People with this form of GLUT1  deficiency syndrome may have  Most affected individuals also have other neurological problems, such as  stiffness caused by , difficulty in  , and  difficulties (). Some  experience episodes of confusion, lack of energy (lethargy), headaches, or  muscle twitches (myoclonus), particularly during periods without food (fasting). html:p About 10 percent of individuals with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome have a form of  the disorder often known as non-epileptic GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, which is  usually less severe than the common form. People with the non-epileptic form do  not have , but they may still have  . Most have movement problems such as ataxia or involuntary  ; the movement problems may be more pronounced than  in the common form. html:p Several conditions that were originally given other names have since been  recognized to be variants of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. These include paroxysmal  choreoathetosis with  (dystonia 9); paroxysmal exercise-induced  dyskinesia and  (dystonia 18); and certain types of . In rare  cases, people with variants of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome produce abnormal red  blood cells and have uncommon forms of a blood condition known as anemia, which  is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells.

Description1: html:p Glutaric acidemia type I is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to  process certain proteins properly. People with this disorder have inadequate  levels of an enzyme that helps break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine,  and tryptophan, which are building blocks of protein. Excessive levels of these  amino acids and their intermediate breakdown products can accumulate and cause  damage to the brain, particularly the basal ganglia, which are regions that help  control movement.  disability may also occur. html:p The severity of glutaric acidemia type I varies widely; some individuals are  only mildly affected, while others have severe problems. In most cases, signs  and symptoms first occur in infancy or early childhood, but in a small number of  affected individuals, the disorder first becomes apparent in adolescence or  adulthood. html:p Some babies with glutaric acidemia type I are born with unusually large heads  (macrocephaly). Affected individuals may have difficulty moving and may  experience spasms, jerking, rigidity, or decreased muscle tone. Some individuals  with glutaric acidemia have developed bleeding in the brain or eyes that could  be mistaken for the effects of child abuse.

Description1: html:p Glutaric acidemia type II is an inherited disorder that interferes with the  body's ability to break down proteins and fats to produce energy. Incompletely  processed proteins and fats can build up in the body and cause the blood and  tissues to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis). html:p Glutaric acidemia type II usually appears in infancy or early childhood as a  sudden episode called a metabolic crisis, in which acidosis and low blood sugar  (hypoglycemia) cause weakness, behavior changes such as poor feeding and  decreased activity, and vomiting.

frequency1: Glutathione synthetase deficiency is very rare. This disorder has been described in more than 70 people worldwide.
Description1: html:p Glutathione synthetase deficiency is a disorder that prevents the production of  an important molecule called glutathione. Glutathione helps prevent damage to  cells by neutralizing harmful molecules generated during energy production.  Glutathione also plays a role in processing medications and cancer-causing  compounds (carcinogens), and building DNA, proteins, and other important  cellular components. html:p Glutathione synthetase deficiency can be classified into three types: mild,  moderate, and severe. Mild glutathione synthetase deficiency usually results in  the destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia). In addition, affected  individuals may release large amounts of a compound called 5-oxoproline in their  urine (5-oxoprolinuria). This compound builds up when glutathione is not  processed correctly in cells. html:p Individuals with moderate glutathione synthetase deficiency may experience  symptoms beginning shortly after birth including hemolytic anemia,  5-oxoprolinuria, and elevated acidity in the blood and tissues (metabolic  acidosis). html:p In addition to the features present in moderate glutathione synthetase  deficiency, individuals affected by the severe form of this disorder may  experience neurological symptoms.

frequency1: The worldwide incidence of glycine encephalopathy is unknown. Its frequency has been studied in only a few regions: this condition affects about 1 in 55,000 newborns in Finland and about 1 in 63,000 newborns in British Columbia, Canada.
Description1: html:p Glycine encephalopathy, which is also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia or  NKH, is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of a molecule  called glycine. This molecule is an amino acid, which is a building block of  proteins. Glycine also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical  messenger that transmits signals in the brain. Glycine encephalopathy is caused  by the shortage of an enzyme that normally breaks down glycine in the body. A  lack of this enzyme allows excess glycine to build up in tissues and organs,  particularly the brain, leading to serious medical problems. html:p The most common form of glycine encephalopathy, called the classical type,  appears shortly after birth. Affected infants experience a progressive lack of  energy (lethargy), feeding difficulties,  (), abnormal  jerking movements, and life-threatening problems with breathing. Most children  who survive these early signs and symptoms develop profound  disability and  that are difficult to treat. For unknown reasons,  affected males are more likely to survive and have less severe developmental  problems than affected females. html:p Researchers have identified several other types of glycine encephalopathy with  variable signs and symptoms. The most common of these atypical types is called  the infantile form. Children with this condition develop normally until they are  about 6 months old, when they experience and may begin  having . As they get older, many develop  disability,  abnormal movements, and  problems. Other atypical types of glycine  encephalopathy appear later in childhood or adulthood and cause a variety of  medical problems that primarily affect the nervous system. html:p Rarely, the characteristic features of classical glycine encephalopathy improve  with time. These cases are classified as transient glycine encephalopathy. In  this form of the condition, glycine levels decrease to normal or near-normal  after being very high at birth. Many children with temporarily high glycine  levels go on to develop normally and experience few long-term medical problems.  disability and  occur in some affected individuals,  however, even after glycine levels decrease.

frequency1: The prevalence of GSD 0 is unknown; fewer than 10 people with the muscle type and fewer than 30 people with the liver type have been described in the scientific literature. Because some people with muscle GSD 0 die from sudden cardiac arrest early in life before a diagnosis is made and many with liver GSD 0 have mild signs and symptoms, it is thought that GSD 0 may be underdiagnosed.
Description1: html:p Glycogen storage disease type 0 (also known as GSD 0) is a condition caused by  the body's inability to form a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major  source of stored energy in the body. GSD 0 has two types: in muscle GSD 0,  glycogen formation in the muscles is impaired, and in liver GSD 0, glycogen  formation in the liver is impaired. html:p The signs and symptoms of muscle GSD 0 typically begin in early childhood.  Affected individuals often experience muscle pain and weakness or episodes of  fainting (syncope) following moderate physical activity, such as walking up  stairs. The loss of consciousness that occurs with fainting typically lasts up  to several hours. Some individuals with muscle GSD 0 have a disruption of the  heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia) known as long QT syndrome. In all affected  individuals, muscle GSD 0 impairs the heart's ability to effectively pump blood  and increases the risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death, particularly after  physical activity. Sudden death from cardiac arrest can occur in childhood or  adolescence in people with muscle GSD 0. html:p Individuals with liver GSD 0 usually show signs and symptoms of the disorder in  infancy. People with this disorder develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) after  going long periods of time without food (fasting). Signs of hypoglycemia become  apparent when affected infants begin sleeping through the night and stop  late-night feedings; these infants exhibit extreme tiredness (lethargy), pale  skin (pallor), and nausea. During episodes of fasting, ketone levels in the  blood may increase (ketosis). Ketones are molecules produced during the  breakdown of fats, which occurs when stored sugars (such as glycogen) are  unavailable. These short-term signs and symptoms of liver GSD 0 often improve  when food is eaten and sugar levels in the body return to normal. The features  of liver GSD 0 vary; they can be mild and go unnoticed for years, or they can  include  and .

There are five types of GSD IV,  which are distinguished by their severity, signs, and symptoms. html:p The fatal perinatal neuromuscular type is the most severe form of GSD IV, with  signs developing before birth. Excess fluid may build up around the fetus  (polyhydramnios) and in the fetus' body. Affected fetuses have a condition  called fetal akinesia deformation sequence, which causes a decrease in fetal  movement and can lead to joint stiffness (arthrogryposis) after birth. Infants  with the fatal perinatal neuromuscular type of GSD IV have very  (severe ) and muscle wasting (atrophy). These infants usually do not  survive past the newborn period due to weakened heart and breathing muscles. html:p The congenital muscular type of GSD IV is usually not evident before birth but  develops in early infancy. Affected infants have severe , which affects  the muscles needed for breathing. These babies often have dilated  cardiomyopathy, which enlarges and weakens the heart (cardiac) muscle,  preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. Infants with the congenital  muscular type of GSD IV typically survive only a few months. html:p The progressive hepatic type is the most common form of GSD IV. Within the first  months of life, affected infants have difficulty gaining weight and growing at  the expected rate (failure to thrive) and develop an enlarged liver  (hepatomegaly). Children with this type develop a form of liver disease called  cirrhosis that often is irreversible. High blood pressure in the vein that  supplies blood to the liver (portal hypertension) and an abnormal buildup of  fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites) can also occur. By age 1 or 2, affected  children develop . Children with the progressive hepatic type of GSD IV  often die of liver failure in early childhood. html:p The non-progressive hepatic type of GSD IV has many of the same features as the  progressive hepatic type, but the liver disease is not as severe. In the  non-progressive hepatic type, hepatomegaly and liver disease are usually evident  in early childhood, but affected individuals typically do not develop  cirrhosis. People with this type of the disorder can also have  and  muscle weakness (myopathy). Most individuals with this type survive into  adulthood, although life expectancy varies depending on the severity of the  signs and symptoms. html:p The childhood neuromuscular type of GSD IV develops in late childhood and is  characterized by myopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. The severity of this type  of GSD IV varies greatly; some people have only mild muscle weakness while  others have severe cardiomyopathy and die in early adulthood.

Description1: html:p Glycogen storage disease type IX (also known as GSD IX) is a condition caused by  the inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen. The different  forms of the condition can affect glycogen breakdown in liver cells or muscle  cells or sometimes both. A lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the normal  function of the affected tissue. html:p When GSD IX affects the liver, the signs and symptoms typically begin in early  childhood. The initial features are usually an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and  . Affected children are often shorter than normal. During prolonged  periods without food (fasting), affected individuals may have low blood sugar  (hypoglycemia) or elevated levels of ketones in the blood (ketosis). Ketones are  molecules produced during the breakdown of fats, which occurs when stored  sugars are unavailable. Affected children may have  , and some have mild muscle  weakness. Puberty is delayed in some adolescents with GSD IX. In the form of the  condition that affects the liver, the signs and symptoms usually improve with  age. Typically, individuals catch up developmentally, and adults reach normal  height. However, some affected individuals have a buildup of scar tissue  (fibrosis) in the liver, which can rarely progress to irreversible liver disease  (cirrhosis). html:p GSD IX can affect muscle tissue, although this form of the condition is very  rare and not well understood. The features of this form of the condition can  appear anytime from childhood to adulthood. Affected individuals may experience  fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps, especially during exercise (exercise  intolerance). Most affected individuals have muscle weakness that worsens over  time. GSD IX can cause myoglobinuria, which occurs when muscle tissue breaks  down abnormally and releases a protein called myoglobin that is excreted in the  urine. Myoglobinuria can cause the urine to be red or brown. html:p In a small number of people with GSD IX, the liver and muscles are both  affected. These individuals develop a combination of the features described  above, although the muscle problems are usually mild.

Description1: html:p Glycogen storage disease type V (also known as GSDV or McArdle disease) is an  inherited disorder caused by an inability to break down a complex sugar called  glycogen in muscle cells. A lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the  function of muscle cells. html:p People with GSDV typically experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during  the first few minutes of exercise (exercise intolerance). Exercise such as  weight lifting or jogging usually triggers these symptoms in affected  individuals. The discomfort is generally alleviated with rest. If individuals  rest after brief exercise and wait for their pain to go away, they can usually  resume exercising with little or no discomfort (a characteristic phenomenon  known as"second wind"). html:p Prolonged or intense exercise can cause muscle damage in people with GSDV. About  half of people with GSDV experience breakdown of muscle tissue  (rhabdomyolysis). In severe episodes, the destruction of muscle tissue releases  a protein called myoglobin, which is filtered through the kidneys and released  in the urine (myoglobinuria). Myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown.  This protein can also damage the kidneys, and it is estimated that half of those  individuals with GSDV who have myoglobinuria will develop life-threatening  kidney failure. html:p The signs and symptoms of GSDV can vary significantly in affected individuals.  The features of this condition typically begin in a person's teens or twenties,  but they can appear anytime from infancy to adulthood. In most people with GSDV,  the muscle weakness worsens over time; however, in about one-third of affected  individuals, the muscle weakness is stable. Some people with GSDV experience  mild symptoms such as poor stamina; others do not experience any symptoms.

Description1: html:p Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSDVII) is an inherited disorder caused by an  inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen in muscle cells. A lack  of glycogen breakdown interferes with the function of muscle cells. html:p There are four types of GSDVII. They are differentiated by their signs and  symptoms and the age at which symptoms first appear. html:p The classical form of GSDVII is the most common form. Its features usually  appear in childhood. This form is characterized by muscle pain and cramps, often  following moderate exercise; strenuous exercise can lead to nausea and  vomiting. During exercise, muscle tissue can be abnormally broken down,  releasing a protein called myoglobin. This protein is processed by the kidneys  and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). If untreated, myoglobinuria can  damage the kidneys and lead to kidney failure. Some people with the classical  form of GSDVII develop high levels of a waste product called uric acid in the  blood (hyperuricemia) because the damaged kidneys are unable to remove uric acid  effectively. Affected individuals may also have elevated levels of a molecule  called bilirubin in the blood that can cause yellowing of the skin and whites of  the eyes (jaundice). Individuals with classical GSDVII often have elevated  levels of an enzyme called creatine kinase in their blood. This finding is a  common indicator of muscle disease. html:p Infants with the severe infantile form of GSDVII have  () at birth, which leads to muscle weakness (myopathy) that worsens  over time. Affected infants have a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy)  and difficulty breathing normally. Individuals with this form of GSDVII usually  do not survive past their first year of life. html:p In the late-onset form of GSDVII, myopathy is typically the only feature. The  muscle weakness appears in adulthood, although some individuals have difficulty  with sustained exercise starting in childhood. The weakness generally affects  the muscles closest to the center of the body (proximal muscles). html:p The hemolytic form of GSDVII is characterized by hemolytic anemia, in which red  blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, causing a shortage  of red blood cells (anemia). People with the hemolytic form of GSDVII do not  experience any signs or symptoms of muscle pain or weakness related to the  disorder.

frequency1: GM1 gangliosidosis is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns. Type I is reported more frequently than the other forms of this condition. Most individuals with type III are of Japanese descent.
Description1: html:p GM1 gangliosidosis is an inherited disorder that progressively destroys nerve  cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. Some researchers classify this  condition into three major types based on the age at which signs and symptoms  first appear. Although the three types differ in severity, their features can  overlap significantly. Because of this overlap, other researchers believe that  GM1 gangliosidosis represents a continuous disease spectrum instead of three  distinct types. html:p The signs and symptoms of the most severe form of GM1 gangliosidosis, called  type I or the infantile form, usually become apparent by the age of 6 months.  Infants with this form of the disorder typically appear normal until their  development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants  eventually  and may develop an exaggerated startle reaction to loud noises. As the  disease progresses, children with GM1 gangliosidosis type I develop an enlarged  liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), skeletal abnormalities, ,  profound  disability, and clouding of the clear outer covering of  the eye (the cornea). Loss of vision occurs as the light-sensing tissue at the  back of the eye (the retina) gradually deteriorates. An eye abnormality called a  cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is  characteristic of this disorder. In some cases, affected individuals have  distinctive facial features that are described as"coarse,"enlarged gums  (gingival hypertrophy), and an enlarged and weakened heart muscle  (cardiomyopathy). Individuals with GM1 gangliosidosis type I usually do not  survive past early childhood. html:p Type II GM1 gangliosidosis consists of intermediate forms of the condition, also  known as the late infantile and juvenile forms. Children with GM1  gangliosidosis type II have normal early development, but they begin to develop  signs and symptoms of the condition around the age of 18 months (late infantile  form) or 5 years (juvenile form). Individuals with GM1 gangliosidosis type II  experience but usually do not have cherry-red spots,  distinctive facial features, or enlarged organs. Type II usually progresses more  slowly than type I, but still causes a shortened life expectancy. People with  the late infantile form typically survive into mid-childhood, while those with  the juvenile form may live into early adulthood. html:p The third type of GM1 gangliosidosis is known as the adult or chronic form, and  it represents the mildest end of the disease spectrum. The age at which symptoms  first appear varies in GM1 gangliosidosis type III, although most affected  individuals develop signs and symptoms in their teens. The characteristic  features of this type include  and abnormalities of the spinal bones (vertebrae). Life expectancy varies among  people with GM1 gangliosidosis type III.

Description1: html:p Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia is a disorder that affects the bones. People with  this condition have reduced bone mineral density (osteopenia), which causes the  bones to be unusually fragile. As a result, affected individuals typically  experience multiple bone fractures in childhood, often from mild trauma or with  no apparent cause. html:p While most bone tissue is less dense than normal in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia,  the outer layer (cortex) of the shafts of the long bones in the arms and legs is  abnormally hard and thick (diaphyseal sclerosis). Bowing of the long bones also  occurs in this disorder. html:p Jaw problems are common in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia; the prefix"gnatho-"in  the condition name refers to the jaw. Affected individuals may develop bone  infections (osteomyelitis) in the jaw, which can lead to pain, swelling,  discharge of pus from the gums, loose teeth, and slow healing after teeth are  lost or extracted. Areas of the jawbone may lose the protective coverage of the  gums, which can result in deterioration of the exposed bone (osteonecrosis of  the jaw). Also, normal bone in areas of the jaw may be replaced by fibrous  tissue and a hard material called cementum, which normally surrounds the roots  of teeth and anchors them in the jaw. These areas of abnormal bone, called  cementoosseous lesions, may be present at birth or develop later in life. html:p When gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia was first described, it was thought to be a  variation of another bone disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta, which is also  characterized by frequent bone fractures. However, gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia  is now generally considered to be a separate condition. Unlike in osteogenesis  imperfecta, the fractures in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia heal normally without  causing deformity or loss of height.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/gorlin-syndrome
frequency1: Gorlin syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 31,000 people. While more than 1 million new cases of basal cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year in the United States, fewer than 1 percent of these skin cancers are related to Gorlin syndrome.
Description1: html:p Gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a  condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of  developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. html:p In people with Gorlin syndrome, the type of cancer diagnosed most often is basal  cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of skin cancer. Individuals with  Gorlin syndrome typically begin to develop basal cell carcinomas during  adolescence or early adulthood. These cancers occur most often on the face,  chest, and back. The number of basal cell carcinomas that develop during a  person's lifetime varies among affected individuals. Some people with Gorlin  syndrome never develop any basal cell carcinomas, while others may develop  thousands of these cancers. Individuals with lighter skin are more likely to  develop basal cell carcinomas than are people with darker skin. html:p Most people with Gorlin syndrome also develop noncancerous (benign) tumors of  the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumors. These tumors usually first  appear during adolescence, and new tumors form until about age 30. Keratocystic  odontogenic tumors rarely develop later in adulthood. If untreated, these tumors  may cause painful facial swelling and tooth displacement. html:p Individuals with Gorlin syndrome have a higher risk than the general population  of developing other tumors. A small proportion of affected individuals develop a  brain tumor called medulloblastoma during childhood. A type of benign tumor  called a fibroma can occur in the heart or in a woman's ovaries. Heart (cardiac)  fibromas often do not cause any symptoms, but they may obstruct blood flow or  cause irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia). Ovarian fibromas are not thought to  affect a woman's ability to have children (fertility). html:p Other features of Gorlin syndrome include small s (pits) in the skin  of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; an unusually large head size  (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead; and skeletal abnormalities involving  the spine, ribs, or skull. These signs and symptoms are typically apparent from  birth or become evident in early childhood.

At least 32 affected infants have been</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">described in the medical literature.</span>
Description1: html:p GRACILE syndrome is a severe disorder that begins before birth. GRACILE stands  for the condition's characteristic features: , aminoaciduria,  cholestasis, iron overload, lactic acidosis, and early death. html:p In GRACILE syndrome,  . Affected newborns are smaller than average and have an inability  to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). A  characteristic of GRACILE syndrome is excess iron in the liver, which likely  begins before birth. Iron levels may begin to improve after birth, although they  typically remain elevated. Within the first day of life, infants with GRACILE  syndrome have a buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic  acidosis). They also have kidney problems that lead to an excess of molecules  called amino acids in the urine (aminoaciduria). Babies with GRACILE syndrome  have cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive  fluid called bile. Cholestasis leads to irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis)  in the first few months of life. html:p Because of the severe health problems caused by GRACILE syndrome, infants with  this condition do not survive for more than a few months, and about half die  within a few days of birth.

frequency1: GPA is a rare disorder that affects an estimated 3 in 100,000 people in the United States.
Description1: html:p Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a condition that causes inflammation  that primarily affects the respiratory tract (including the lungs and airways)  and the kidneys. This disorder is also commonly known as Wegener granulomatosis.  A characteristic feature of GPA is inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis),  particularly the small- and medium-sized blood vessels in the lungs, nose,  sinuses, windpipe, and kidneys, although vessels in any organ can be involved.  Polyangiitis refers to the inflammation of multiple types of vessels, such as  small arteries and veins. Vasculitis causes scarring and tissue death in the  vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs. html:p Another characteristic feature of GPA is the formation of granulomas, which are  small areas of inflammation composed of immune cells that aid in the  inflammatory reaction. The granulomas usually occur in the lungs or airways of  people with this condition, although they can occur in the eyes or other organs.  As granulomas grow, they can invade surrounding areas, causing tissue damage. html:p The signs and symptoms of GPA vary based on the tissues and organs affected by  vasculitis. Many people with this condition experience a vague feeling of  discomfort (malaise), fever, weight loss, or other general symptoms of the  body's immune reaction. In most people with GPA, inflammation begins in the  vessels of the respiratory tract, leading to nasal congestion, frequent  nosebleeds, shortness of breath, or coughing. Severe inflammation in the nose  can lead to a hole in the tissue that separates the two nostrils (nasal septum  perforation) or a collapse of the septum, causing a sunken bridge of the nose  (saddle nose). html:p The kidneys are commonly affected in people with GPA. Tissue damage caused by  vasculitis in the kidneys can lead to decreased kidney function, which may cause  increased blood pressure or blood in the urine, and life-threatening kidney  failure. Inflammation can also occur in other regions of the body, including the  eyes, middle and inner ear structures, skin, nerves, heart, and brain.  Depending on which systems are involved, additional symptoms can include skin  rashes, inner ear pain, and numbness or tingling in  the limbs. html:p GPA is most common in middle-aged adults, although it can occur at any age. If  untreated, the condition is usually fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Even  after treatment, vasculitis can return.

The disease occurs more often</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">in women than in men, which may be related to hormonal factors. Graves disease</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">is the most common cause of thyroid overactivity (hyperthyroidism) in the United</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">States.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Graves disease is a condition that affects the function of the thyroid, which is</span>  a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck. The thyroid makes hormones that  help regulate a wide variety of critical body functions. For example, thyroid  hormones influence, body temperature, heart rate,  menstrual cycles, and weight. In people with Graves disease, the thyroid is  overactive and makes more hormones than the body needs. The condition usually  appears in mid-adulthood, although it may occur at any age. html:p Excess thyroid hormones can cause a variety of signs and symptoms. These include  nervousness or , extreme tiredness (fatigue), a rapid and irregular  heartbeat, s, frequent bowel movements or diarrhea, increased  sweating and difficulty tolerating hot conditions, trouble sleeping, and weight  loss in spite of an increased appetite. Affected women may have menstrual  irregularities, such as an unusually light menstrual flow and infrequent  periods. Some people with Graves disease develop an enlargement of the thyroid  called a goiter. Depending on its size, the enlarged thyroid can cause the neck  to look swollen and may interfere with breathing and swallowing. html:p Between 25 and 50 percent of people with Graves disease have eye abnormalities,  which are known as Graves ophthalmopathy. These eye problems can include  swelling and inflammation, redness, dryness, puffy eyelids, and a gritty  sensation like having sand or dirt in the eyes. Some people develop bulging of  the eyes caused by inflammation of tissues behind the eyeball and"pulling back"  (retraction) of the eyelids. Rarely, affected individuals have more serious eye  problems, such as pain, double vision, and pinching (compression) of the optic  nerve connecting the eye and the brain, which can cause vision loss. html:p A small percentage of people with Graves disease develop a skin abnormality  called pretibial myxedema or Graves dermopathy. This abnormality causes the skin  on the front of the lower legs and the tops of the feet to become thick, lumpy,  and red. It is not usually painful.

frequency1: Gray platelet syndrome appears to be a rare disorder. About 60 cases have been reported worldwide.
Description1: html:p Gray platelet syndrome is a bleeding disorder associated with abnormal  platelets, which are blood cell fragments involved in blood clotting. People  with this condition tend to bruise easily and have an increased risk of  nosebleeds (epistaxis). They may also experience abnormally heavy or extended  bleeding following surgery, dental work, or minor trauma. Women with gray  platelet syndrome often have irregular, heavy periods (menometrorrhagia). These  bleeding problems are usually mild to moderate, but they have been  life-threatening in a few affected individuals. html:p A condition called myelofibrosis, which is a buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis)  in the bone marrow, is another common feature of gray platelet syndrome. Bone  marrow is the spongy tissue in the center of long bones that produces most of  the blood cells the body needs, including platelets. The scarring associated  with myelofibrosis damages bone marrow, preventing it from making enough blood  cells. Other organs, particularly the spleen, start producing more blood cells  to compensate; this process often leads to an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly).

Description1: html:p Guillain-Barrésyndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves.  Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the  body's own tissues and organs. In Guillain-Barrésyndrome, the immune response  damages peripheral nerves, which are the nerves that connect the central nervous  system (the brain and spinal cord) to the limbs and organs. Specifically, the  immune response affects a particular part of peripheral nerves called axons,  which are the extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit nerve impulses.  Guillain-Barrésyndrome can affect the neurons that control muscle movement  (motor neurons); the neurons that transmit sensory signals such as pain,  temperature, and touch (sensory neurons); or both. As a result, affected  individuals can experience muscle weakness or lose the ability to feel certain  sensations. html:p Muscle weakness or paralysis are the characteristic features of Guillain-Barré  syndrome. The weakness often begins in the legs and spreads to the arms, torso,  and face and is commonly accompanied by numbness, tingling, or pain. Additional  signs and symptoms of the condition include difficulty swallowing and difficulty  breathing. Occasionally, the nerves that control involuntary functions of the  body such as blood pressure and heart rate are affected, which can lead to  fluctuating blood pressure or an abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia). html:p There are several types of Guillain-Barrésyndrome, classified by the part of  the peripheral nerve involved in the condition. The most common type of  Guillain-Barrésyndrome is acute inflammatory demyelinating  polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). In AIDP, the immune response damages myelin,  which is the covering that protects axons and promotes the efficient  transmission of nerve impulses. In two other types of Guillain-Barrésyndrome,  acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy  (AMSAN), the axons themselves are damaged by the immune response. In AMAN, only  the axons of motor neurons are damaged. In AMSAN, the axons of sensory neurons  are also damaged. Because of sensory nerve damage, affected individuals can lose  the ability to sense the position of their limbs and can have abnormal or  absent reflexes (areflexia). html:p Miller Fisher syndrome, another type of Guillain-Barrésyndrome, involves  cranial nerves, which extend from the brain to various areas of the head and  neck. Miller Fisher syndrome is characterized by three features: weakness or  paralysis of the muscles that move the eyes (ophthalmoplegia), problems with  , and areflexia. People with this condition can  have other signs and symptoms common in Guillain-Barrésyndrome, such as muscle  weakness. html:p Guillain-Barrésyndrome occurs in people of all ages. The development of the  condition usually follows a pattern. Prior to developing the condition, most  people with Guillain-Barrésyndrome have a bacterial or viral infection. The  first phase of Guillain-Barrésyndrome, during which signs and symptoms of the  condition worsen, can last up to four weeks, although the peak of the illness is  usually reached in one to two weeks. During the second phase, called the  plateau, signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barrésyndrome stabilize. This phase can  last weeks or months. During the recovery phase, symptoms improve. However,  some people with Guillain-Barrésyndrome never fully recover and can still  experience excessive tiredness (fatigue), muscle weakness, or muscle pain.

frequency1: More than 150 individuals with gyrate atrophy have been identified; approximately one third are from Finland.
Description1: html:p Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina, which is often shortened to gyrate  atrophy, is an inherited disorder characterized by progressive vision loss.  People with this disorder have an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the retina,  which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye,  and in a nearby tissue layer called the choroid. During childhood, they begin  experiencing nearsightedness (myopia), difficulty seeing in low light (night  blindness), and loss of side (peripheral) vision. Over time, their field of  vision continues to narrow, resulting in tunnel vision. Many people with gyrate  atrophy also develop clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts). These  progressive vision changes lead to blindness by about the age of 50. html:p Most people with gyrate atrophy have no symptoms other than vision loss, but  some have additional features of the disorder. Occasionally, newborns with  gyrate atrophy develop excess ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), which may  lead to poor feeding, vomiting, , or coma. Neonatal hyperammonemia  associated with gyrate atrophy generally responds quickly to treatment and does  not recur after the newborn period. html:p Gyrate atrophy usually does not affect intelligence; however, abnormalities may  be observed in brain imaging or other neurological testing. In some cases, mild  to moderate  disability is associated with gyrate atrophy. html:p Gyrate atrophy may also cause disturbances in the nerves connecting the brain  and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells (peripheral nervous system). In  some people with the disorder these abnormalities lead to numbness, tingling, or  pain in the hands or feet, while in others they are detectable only by  electrical testing of the nerve impulses. html:p In some people with gyrate atrophy, a particular type of muscle fibers (type II  fibers) break down over time. While this muscle abnormality usually causes no  symptoms, it may result in mild weakness.

frequency1: Hajdu-Cheney syndrome is a rare disease; its prevalence is unknown. Fewer than 100 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Hajdu-Cheney syndrome is a rare disorder that can affect many parts of the body,  particularly the bones. Loss of bone tissue from the hands and feet  (acro-osteolysis) is a characteristic feature of the condition. The fingers and  toes are short and broad, and they may become shorter over time as bone at the  tips continues to break down. Bone loss in the fingers can interfere with fine  motor skills, such as picking up small objects. html:p Bone abnormalities throughout the body are common in Hajdu-Cheney syndrome.  Affected individuals develop osteoporosis, which causes the bones to be brittle  and prone to fracture. Many affected individuals experience breakage  (compression fractures) of the spinal bones (vertebrae). Some also develop  abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis). Hajdu-Cheney syndrome  also affects the shape and strength of the long bones in the arms and legs. The  abnormalities associated with this condition lead to . html:p Hajdu-Cheney syndrome also causes abnormalities of the skull bones, including  the bones of the face. The shape of the skull is often described as  dolichocephalic, which means it is elongated from back to front. In many  affected individuals, the bone at the back of the skull bulges outward, causing  a bump called a prominent occiput. Distinctive facial features associated with  this condition include widely spaced and downward-slanting eyes, eyebrows that  grow together in the middle (synophrys), low-set ears,  , and a large space between the nose  and upper lip (a long philtrum). Some affected children are born with an opening  in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate or with a high arched palate. In  affected adults, the facial features are often described as"coarse." html:p Other features of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome found in some affected individuals  include joint abnormalities, particularly an unusually large range of joint  movement (hypermobility); dental problems; hearing loss; a deep, gravelly voice;  excess body hair; recurrent infections in childhood; s; and kidney  abnormalities such as the growth of multiple fluid-filled cysts (polycystic  kidneys). Some people with this condition have  in childhood,  but the delays are usually mild. html:p The most serious complications of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, which occur in about  half of all affected individuals, are abnormalities known as platybasia and  basilar invagination. Platybasia is a flattening of the base of the skull caused  by thinning and softening of the skull bones. Basilar invagination occurs when  the softened bones allow part of the spine to protrude abnormally through the  opening at the bottom of the skull, pushing into the lower parts of the brain.  These abnormalities can lead to severe neurological problems, including  headaches, abnormal vision and balance, a buildup of fluid in the brain  (hydrocephalus), abnormal breathing, and sudden death. html:p The signs and symptoms of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome vary greatly among affected  individuals, even among members of the same family. Many of the disorder's  features, such as acro-osteolysis and some of the characteristic facial  features, are not present at birth but become apparent in childhood or later.  The risk of developing platybasia and basilar invagination also increases over  time. html:p The features of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome overlap significantly with those of a  condition called serpentine fibula-polycystic kidney syndrome (SFPKS). Although  they used to be considered separate disorders, researchers discovered that the  two conditions are associated with mutations in the same gene. Based on these  similarities, many researchers now consider Hajdu-Cheney syndrome and SFPKS to  be variants of the same condition.

Description1: html:p Harlequin ichthyosis is a severe genetic disorder that mainly affects the skin.  Infants with this condition are born with very hard, thick skin covering most  of their bodies. The skin forms large, diamond-shaped plates that are separated  by deep cracks (fissures). These skin abnormalities affect the shape of the  eyelids, nose, mouth, and ears, and limit movement of the arms and legs.  Restricted movement of the chest can lead to breathing difficulties and  respiratory failure. html:p The skin normally forms a protective barrier between the body and its  surrounding environment. The skin abnormalities associated with harlequin  ichthyosis disrupt this barrier, making it more difficult for affected infants  to control water loss, regulate their body temperature, and fight infections.  Infants with harlequin ichthyosis often experience an excessive loss of fluids  (dehydration) and develop life-threatening infections in the first few weeks of  life. It used to be very rare for affected infants to survive the newborn  period. However, with intensive medical support and improved treatment, people  with this disorder now have a better chance of living into childhood and  adolescence.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process. People</span>  with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury,  surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases of hemophilia, continuous  bleeding occurs after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous  bleeding). Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints,  muscles, brain, or other internal organs. Milder forms of hemophilia do not  necessarily involve spontaneous bleeding, and the condition may not become  apparent until abnormal bleeding occurs following surgery or a serious injury. html:p The major types of this condition are hemophilia A (also known as classic  hemophilia or factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (also known as Christmas  disease or factor IX deficiency). Although the two types have very similar signs  and symptoms, they are caused by mutations in different genes. People with an  unusual form of hemophilia B, known as hemophilia B Leyden, experience episodes  of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty.

Name1: Hennekam syndrome
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hennekam-syndrome
frequency1: At least 50 cases of Hennekam syndrome have been reported worldwide.
Description1: html:p Hennekam syndrome is an inherited disorder resulting from malformation of the  lymphatic system, which is part of both the circulatory system and immune  system. The lymphatic system consists of a network of vessels that transport  lymph fluid and immune cells throughout the body. html:p The characteristic signs and symptoms of Hennekam syndrome are lymphatic vessels  that are abnormally expanded (lymphangiectasia), particularly the vessels that  transport lymph fluid to and from the intestines; puffiness or swelling caused  by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema); and unusual facial features. html:p Lymphangiectasia often impedes the flow of lymph fluid and can cause the  affected vessels to break open (rupture). In the intestines, ruptured vessels  can lead to accumulation of lymph fluid, which interferes with the absorption of  nutrients, fats, and proteins. Accumulation of lymph fluid in the abdomen can  cause swelling (chylous ascites). Lymphangiectasia can also affect the kidneys,  thyroid gland, the outer covering of the lungs (the pleura), the membrane  covering the heart (pericardium), or the skin. html:p The lymphedema in Hennekam syndrome is often noticeable at birth and usually  affects the face and limbs. Severely affected infants may have extensive  swelling caused by fluid accumulation before birth (hydrops fetalis). The  lymphedema usually affects one side of the body more severely than the other  (asymmetric) and slowly worsens over time. html:p Facial features of people with Hennekam syndrome may include a flattened  appearance to the middle of the face and the bridge of the nose, puffy eyelids,  widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), small ears, and a small mouth with  overgrowth of the gums (gingival hypertrophy). Affected individuals may also  have an unusually small head (microcephaly) and premature fusion of the skull  bones (craniosynostosis). html:p Individuals with Hennekam syndrome often have  disability that  ranges from mild to severe, although most are on the mild end of the range and  some have normal intellect. Many individuals with Hennekam syndrome have  , respiratory problems, permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly),  or fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly). html:p Abnormalities found in a few individuals with Hennekam syndrome include a  moderate to severe shortage of red blood cells (anemia) resulting from an  inadequate amount (deficiency) of iron in the bloodstream, multiple spleens  (polysplenia), misplaced kidneys, genital anomalies, a soft out-pouching around  the belly-button (umbilical hernia), heart abnormalities, hearing loss,  excessive body hair growth (hirsutism), a narrow upper chest that may have a  sunken appearance (pectus excavatum), an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the  spine (scoliosis), and inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet). html:p The signs and symptoms of Hennekam syndrome vary widely among affected  individuals, even those within the same family. Life expectancy depends on the  severity of the condition and can vary from death in childhood to survival into  adulthood.

frequency1: Hepatic lipase deficiency is likely a rare disorder; only a few affected families have been reported in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Hepatic lipase deficiency is a disorder that affects the body's ability to break  down fats (lipids). People with this disorder have increased amounts of certain  fats, known as triglycerides and cholesterol, in the blood. These individuals  also have increased amounts of molecules known as high-density lipoproteins  (HDLs) and decreased amounts of molecules called low-density lipoproteins (LDL).  These molecules transport triglycerides and cholesterol throughout the body. In  people with hepatic lipase deficiency, the LDL molecules are often abnormally  large. html:p Normally, high levels of HDL (known as"good cholesterol") and low levels of LDL  (known as"bad cholesterol") are protective against an accumulation of fatty  deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis) and heart disease. However, some  individuals with hepatic lipase deficiency, who have this imbalance of HDL and  LDL, develop atherosclerosis and heart disease in mid-adulthood, while others do  not. It is unknown whether people with hepatic lipase deficiency have a greater  risk of developing atherosclerosis or heart disease than individuals in the  general population. Similarly, it is unclear how increased blood triglycerides  and cholesterol levels affect the risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease in  people with hepatic lipase deficiency.

However, the disorder has also been identified in several individuals with other backgrounds in the United States and Italy.
Description1: html:p Hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (also called VODI) is a  hereditary disorder of the liver and immune system. Its signs and symptoms  appear after the first few months of life. html:p Hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a condition that blocks (occludes) small veins  in the liver, disrupting blood flow in this organ. This condition can lead to  enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), a buildup of scar tissue (hepatic  fibrosis), and liver failure. html:p Children with VODI are prone to recurrent infections caused by certain bacteria,  viruses, and fungi. The organisms that cause infection in people with this  disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause  illness in healthy people. These infections are usually serious and may be  life-threatening. In most people with VODI, infections occur before hepatic  veno-occlusive disease becomes evident. html:p Many people with VODI live only into childhood, although some affected  individuals have lived to early adulthood.

frequency1: Hereditary angioedema is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 people. Type I is the most common, accounting for 85 percent of cases. Type II occurs in 15 percent of cases, and type III is very rare.
Description1: html:p Hereditary angioedema is a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of  severe swelling (angioedema). The most common areas of the body to develop  swelling are the limbs, face, intestinal tract, and airway. Minor trauma or  stress may trigger an attack, but swelling often occurs without a known trigger.  Episodes involving the intestinal tract cause severe abdominal pain, nausea,  and vomiting. Swelling in the airway can restrict breathing and lead to  life-threatening obstruction of the airway. About one-third of people with this  condition develop a non-itchy rash called erythema marginatum during an attack. html:p Symptoms of hereditary angioedema typically begin in childhood and worsen during  puberty. On average, untreated individuals have an attack every 1 to 2 weeks,  and most episodes last for about 3 to 4 days. The frequency and duration of  attacks vary greatly among people with hereditary angioedema, even among people  in the same family. html:p There are three types of hereditary angioedema, called types I, II, and III,  which can be distinguished by their underlying causes and levels of a protein  called C1 inhibitor in the blood. The different types have similar signs and  symptoms. Type III was originally thought to occur only in women, but families  with affected males have been identified.

Description1: html:p Hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps (HANAC)  html:i  COL4A1         html:p People with HANAC syndrome develop kidney disease (nephropathy). Fragile or  damaged blood vessels or basement membranes in the kidneys can lead to blood in  the urine (hematuria). Cysts can also form in one or both kidneys, and the cysts  may grow larger over time. html:p html:i  COL4A1             html:p Muscle cramps experienced by most people with HANAC syndrome typically begin in  early childhood. Any muscle may be affected, and cramps usually last from a few  seconds to a few minutes, although in some cases they can last for several  hours. Muscle cramps can be spontaneous or triggered by exercise. html:p Individuals with HANAC syndrome also experience a variety of eye problems. All  individuals with this condition have arteries that twist and turn abnormally  within the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eyes (arterial retinal  tortuosity). This blood vessel abnormality can cause episodes of bleeding within  the eyes following any minor trauma to the eyes, leading to temporary vision  loss. Other eye problems associated with HANAC syndrome include a clouding of  the lens of the eye (cataract) and an abnormality called Axenfeld-Rieger  anomaly. Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly is associated with various other eye  abnormalities, including underdevelopment and eventual tearing of the colored  part of the eye (iris), and a pupil that is not in the center of the eye. html:p Rarely, affected individuals will have a condition called Raynaud phenomenon in  which the blood vessels in the fingers and toes temporarily narrow, restricting  blood flow to the fingertips and the ends of the toes. As a result, the skin  around the affected area may turn white or blue for a brief period of time and  the area may tingle or throb. Raynaud phenomenon is typically triggered by  changes in temperature and usually causes no long term damage.

Individuals with the  Piedmont type may have one or more strokes and typically experience impaired  movements, numbness or tingling (paresthesias), confusion, or dementia. html:p The first sign of the Icelandic type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy  is typically a stroke followed by dementia. Strokes associated with the  Icelandic type usually occur earlier than the other types, with individuals  typically experiencing their first stroke in their twenties or thirties. html:p Strokes are rare in people with the Arctic type of hereditary cerebral amyloid  angiopathy, in which the first sign is usually memory loss that then progresses  to severe dementia. Strokes are also uncommon in individuals with the Iowa type.  This type is characterized by memory loss, problems with vocabulary and the  production of , personality changes, and involuntary muscle twitches  (myoclonus). html:p Two types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, known as familial British  dementia and familial Danish dementia, are characterized by dementia and  movement problems.

frequency1: Gastric cancer is the fourth most common form of cancer worldwide, affecting 900,000 people per year. HDGC probably accounts for less than 1 percent of these cases.
Description1: html:p Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an inherited disorder that greatly  increases the chance of developing a form of stomach (gastric) cancer. In this  form, known as diffuse gastric cancer, there is no solid tumor. Instead  cancerous (malignant) cells multiply underneath the stomach lining, making the  lining thick and rigid. The invasive nature of this type of cancer makes it  highly likely that these cancer cells will spread (metastasize) to other  tissues, such as the liver or nearby bones. html:p Symptoms of diffuse gastric cancer occur late in the disease and can include  stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), decreased  appetite, and weight loss. If the cancer metastasizes to other tissues, it may  lead to an enlarged liver, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), an  abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), firm lumps under  the skin, or broken bones. html:p In HDGC, gastric cancer usually occurs in a person's late thirties or early  forties, although it can develop anytime during adulthood. If diffuse gastric  cancer is detected early, the survival rate is high; however, because this type  of cancer is hidden underneath the stomach lining, it is usually not diagnosed  until the cancer has become widely invasive. At that stage of the disease, the  survival rate is approximately 20 percent. html:p Some people with HDGC have an increased risk of developing other types of  cancer, such as a form of breast cancer in women that begins in the  milk-producing glands (lobular breast cancer); prostate cancer; and cancers of  the colon (large intestine) and rectum, which are collectively referred to as  colorectal cancer. Most people with HDGC have family members who have had one of  the types of cancer associated with HDGC. In some families, all the affected  members have diffuse gastric cancer. In other families, some affected members  have diffuse gastric cancer and others have another associated form of cancer,  such as lobular breast cancer. Frequently, HDGC-related cancers develop in  individuals before the age of 50.

Description1: html:p Hereditary folate malabsorption is a disorder that interferes with the body's  ability to absorb certain B vitamins (called folates) from food. Folates are  important for many cell functions, including the production of DNA and its  chemical cousin, RNA. html:p Infants with hereditary folate malabsorption are born with normal amounts of  folates in their body because they obtain these vitamins from their mother's  blood before birth. They generally begin to show signs and symptoms of the  disorder within the first few months of life because their ability to absorb  folates from food is impaired. html:p Infants with hereditary folate malabsorption experience feeding difficulties,  diarrhea, and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to  thrive). Affected individuals usually develop a blood disorder called  megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number  of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than  normal (megaloblastic). The symptoms of this blood disorder may include  decreased appetite, lack of energy, headaches, pale skin, and tingling or  numbness in the hands and feet. People with hereditary folate malabsorption may  also have a deficiency of white blood cells (leukopenia), leading to increased  susceptibility to infections. In addition, they may have a reduction in the  amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can result in easy bruising and  abnormal bleeding. html:p Some infants with hereditary folate malabsorption exhibit neurological problems  and .

frequency1: The incidence of hereditary fructose intolerance is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 to 30,000 individuals each year worldwide.
Description1: html:p Hereditary fructose intolerance is a condition that affects a person's ability  to digest the sugar fructose. Fructose is a simple sugar found primarily in  fruits. Affected individuals develop signs and symptoms of the disorder in  infancy when fruits, juices, or other foods containing fructose are introduced  into the diet. After ingesting fructose, individuals with hereditary fructose  intolerance may experience nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting,  and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Affected infants may fail to grow and gain  weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). html:p Repeated ingestion of fructose-containing foods can lead to liver and kidney  damage. The liver damage can result in a yellowing of the skin and whites of the  eyes (jaundice), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and chronic liver disease  (cirrhosis). Continued exposure to fructose may result in , coma, and  ultimately death from liver and kidney failure. Due to the severity of symptoms  experienced when fructose is ingested, most people with hereditary fructose  intolerance develop a dislike for fruits, juices, and other foods containing  fructose. html:p Hereditary fructose intolerance should not be confused with a condition called  fructose malabsorption. In people with fructose malabsorption, the cells of the  intestine cannot absorb fructose normally, leading to bloating, diarrhea or  constipation, flatulence, and stomach pain. Fructose malabsorption is thought to  affect approximately 40 percent of individuals in the Western hemisphere; its  cause is unknown.

GHR-webpage1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hemochromatosis</span>
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Type 1 hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">United States, affecting about 1 million people. It most often affects people</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">of Northern European descent. The other types of hemochromatosis are considered</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">rare and have been studied in only a small number of families worldwide.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much</span>  iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs,  particularly the skin, heart, liver, pancreas, and joints. Because humans  cannot increase the excretion of iron, excess iron can overload and eventually  damage tissues and organs. For this reason, hereditary hemochromatosis is also  called an iron overload disorder. html:p Early symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and may include  fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain, and loss of sex drive. Later signs and  symptoms can include arthritis, liver disease, diabetes, heart abnormalities,  and skin discoloration. The appearance and progression of symptoms can be  affected by environmental and lifestyle factors such as the amount of iron in  the diet, alcohol use, and infections. html:p Hereditary hemochromatosis is classified by type depending on the age of onset  and other factors such as genetic cause and mode of inheritance. Type 1, the  most common form of the disorder, and type 4 (also called ferroportin disease)  begin in adulthood. Men with type 1 or type 4 hemochromatosis typically develop  symptoms between the ages of 40 and 60, and women usually develop symptoms after  menopause. html:p Type 2 hemochromatosis is a juvenile-onset disorder. Iron accumulation begins  early in life, and symptoms may appear in childhood. By age 20, decreased or  absent secretion of sex hormones is evident. Females usually begin menstruation  in a normal manner, but menses stop after a few years. Males may experience  delayed puberty or symptoms related to a shortage of sex hormones. If the  disorder is untreated, heart disease becomes evident by age 30. html:p The onset of type 3 hemochromatosis is usually intermediate between types 1 and  2. Symptoms of type 3 hemochromatosis generally begin before age 30.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">The incidence of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is difficult to</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">determine because the severity of symptoms can vary widely and some symptoms,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">such as frequent nosebleeds, are common in the general population.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a disorder that results in the</span>  development of. html:p In the circulatory system, blood carrying oxygen from the lungs is normally  pumped by the heart into the arteries at high pressure. The pressure allows the  blood to make its way through the arteries to the smaller vessels (arterioles  and capillaries) that supply oxygen to the body's tissues. By the time blood  reaches the capillaries, the pressure is much lower. The blood then proceeds  from the capillaries into veins, through which it eventually returns to the  heart. html:p In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, some arterial vessels flow directly  into veins rather than into the capillaries. These abnormalities are called  arteriovenous malformations. When they occur in vessels near the surface of the  skin, where they are visible as red markings, they are known as telangiectases  (the singular is telangiectasia). html:p Without the normal buffer of the capillaries, the blood moves from the arteries  at high pressure into the thinner walled, less elastic veins. The extra pressure  tends to strain and enlarge these blood vessels, and may result in compression  or irritation of adjacent tissues and frequent episodes of severe bleeding  (hemorrhage). Nosebleeds are very common in people with hereditary hemorrhagic  telangiectasia, and more serious problems may arise from hemorrhages in the  brain, liver, lungs, or other organs. html:p There are several forms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, distinguished  mainly by their genetic cause but with some differences in patterns of signs and  symptoms. People with type 1 tend to develop symptoms earlier than those with  type 2, and are more likely to have blood vessel malformations in the lungs and  brain. Type 2 and type 3 may be associated with a higher risk of liver  involvement. Women are more likely than men to develop blood vessel  malformations in the lungs with type 1, and are also at higher risk of liver  involvement with both type 1 and type 2. Individuals with any form of hereditary  hemorrhagic telangiectasia, however, can have any of these problems. html:p Juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome is a condition  that involves both arteriovenous malformations and a tendency to develop  growths (polyps) in the gastrointestinal tract. Hereditary hemorrhagic  telangiectasia types 1, 2 and 3 do not appear to increase the likelihood of such  polyps.

Description1: html:p Hereditary hyperekplexia is a condition in which affected infants have increased  muscle tone (hypertonia) and an exaggerated startle reaction to unexpected  stimuli, especially loud noises. Following the startle reaction, infants  experience a brief period in which they are very rigid and unable to move.  During these rigid periods, some infants stop breathing, which, if prolonged,  can be fatal.

Description1: html:p Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is a disorder in which  affected individuals tend to develop benign tumors containing smooth muscle  tissue (leiomyomas) in the skin and, in females, the uterus. This condition also  increases the risk of kidney cancer. html:p In this disorder, growths on the skin (cutaneous leiomyomas) typically develop  in the third decade of life. Most of these growths arise from the tiny muscles  around the hair follicles that cause"goosebumps". They appear as bumps or  nodules on the trunk, arms, legs, and occasionally on the face. Cutaneous  leiomyomas may be the same color as the surrounding skin, or they may be darker.  Some affected individuals have no cutaneous leiomyomas or only a few, but the  growths tend to increase in size and number over time. Cutaneous leiomyomas are  often more sensitive than the surrounding skin to cold or light touch, and may  be painful. html:p Most women with HLRCC also develop uterine leiomyomas (fibroids). While uterine  fibroids are very common in the general population, women with HLRCC tend to  have numerous large fibroids that appear earlier than in the general population. html:p Approximately 10 percent to 16 percent of people with HLRCC develop a type of  kidney cancer called renal cell cancer. The signs and symptoms of renal cell  cancer may include lower back pain, blood in the urine, or a mass in the kidney  that can be felt upon physical examination. Some people with renal cell cancer  have no symptoms until the disease is advanced. The average age at which people  with HLRCC are diagnosed with kidney cancer is in their forties. html:p This disorder, especially if it appears in individuals or families without renal  cell cancer, is also sometimes called multiple cutaneous leiomyomatosis (MCL)  or multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis (MCUL).

The number of  osteochondromas and the bones on which they are located vary greatly among  affected individuals. The osteochondromas are not present at birth, but  approximately 96 percent of affected people develop multiple osteochondromas by  the time they are 12 years old. Osteochondromas typically form at the end of  long bones and on flat bones such as the hip and shoulder blade. html:p Multiple osteochondromas can disrupt bone growth and can cause growth  disturbances of the arms, hands, and legs, leading to . Often these  problems with bone growth do not affect the right and left limb equally,  resulting in uneven limb lengths (limb length discrepancy). Bowing of the  forearm or ankle and  caused by osteochondromas can lead to difficulty walking and general discomfort.  Multiple osteochondromas may also result in pain, limited range of joint  movement, and pressure on nerves, blood vessels, the spinal cord, and tissues  surrounding the osteochondromas. html:p Osteochondromas are typically benign; however, in some instances these tumors  become malignant (cancerous).

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-myopathy-with-early-respiratory-fai lure
frequency1: HMERF is a rare condition. It has been reported in several families of Swedish and French descent, and in at least one individual from Italy.
Description1: html:p Hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF) is an inherited  muscle disease that predominantly affects muscles close to the center of the  body (proximal muscles) and muscles that are needed for breathing. html:p The major signs and symptoms of HMERF usually appear in adulthood, on average  around age 35. Among the earliest muscles affected in HMERF are the neck  flexors, which are muscles at the front of the neck that help hold the head up.  Other proximal muscles that become weak in people with HMERF include those of  the hips, thighs, and upper arms. Some affected individuals have also reported  weakness in muscles of the lower leg and foot called the dorsal foot extensors. html:p HMERF also causes severe weakness in muscles of the chest that are involved in  breathing, particularly the diaphragm. This weakness leads to breathing problems  and life-threatening respiratory failure.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-neuralgic-amyotrophy
frequency1: Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is a rare disorder, but its specific prevalence is unknown. Approximately 200 families affected by the disorder have been identified worldwide.
Description1: html:p Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is a disorder characterized by episodes of  severe pain and muscle wasting (amyotrophy) in one or both shoulders and arms.  Neuralgic pain is felt along the path of one or more nerves and often has no  obvious physical cause. The network of nerves involved in hereditary neuralgic  amyotrophy, called the brachial plexus, controls movement and sensation in the  shoulders and arms. html:p People with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy usually begin experiencing attacks  in their twenties, but episodes have occurred as early as the age of 1 year in  some individuals. The attacks may be spontaneous or triggered by stress such as  strenuous exercise, childbirth, surgery, exposure to cold, infections,  immunizations, or emotional disturbance. While the frequency of the episodes  tends to decrease with age, affected individuals are often left with residual  problems, such as chronic pain and impaired movement, that accumulate over time. html:p Typically an attack begins with severe pain on one or both sides of the body;  right-sided involvement is most common. The pain may be difficult to control  with medication and usually lasts about a month. Within a period of time ranging  from a few hours to a couple of weeks, the muscles in the affected area begin  to weaken and waste away (atrophy), and movement becomes difficult. Muscle  wasting may cause changes in posture or in the appearance of the shoulder, back,  and arm. In particular, weak shoulder muscles tend to make the shoulder blades  (scapulae)"stick out"from the back, a common sign known as scapular winging.  Additional features of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy may include decreased  sensation (hypoesthesia) and abnormal sensations in the skin such as numbness or  tingling (paresthesias). Areas other than the shoulder and arm may also be  involved. html:p In a few affected families, individuals with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy  also have unusual physical characteristics including , excess skin  folds on the neck and arms, an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate),  a split in the soft flap of tissue that hangs from the back of the mouth (bifid  uvula), and partially webbed or fused fingers or toes (partial syndactyly). They  may also have distinctive facial features including eyes set close together  (ocular hypotelorism), a narrow opening of the eyelids (short palpebral  fissures) with a skin fold covering the inner corner of the eye (epicanthal  fold), a long nasal bridge, a narrow mouth, and differences between one side of  the face and the other (facial asymmetry).

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-neuropathy-with-liability-to-pressu re-palsies
frequency1: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is estimated to occur in 2 to 5 per 100,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is a disorder that  affects peripheral nerves. These nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to  muscles and sensory cells that detect touch, pain, and temperature. In people  with this disorder, the peripheral nerves are unusually sensitive to pressure,  such as the pressure that occurs when carrying heavy grocery bags, leaning on an  elbow, or sitting without changing position, particularly with crossed legs.  These activities would not normally cause sensation problems in people without  the disorder. html:p Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by  recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in  the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or  foot. An episode can last from several minutes to several months, but recovery  is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle  weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the  limbs, especially the hands. html:p A pressure palsy episode results from pressure on a single nerve, and any  peripheral nerve can be affected. Although episodes often recur, they can affect  different nerves. The most common problem sites involve nerves in the wrists,  elbows, and knees. The fingers, shoulders, hands, feet, and scalp can also be  affected. Many people with this disorder experience carpal tunnel syndrome,  which occurs when a nerve in the wrist (the median nerve) is involved. Carpal  tunnel syndrome is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand  and fingers. An episode in the hand may affect fine motor activities such as  writing, opening jars, and fastening buttons. An episode of nerve compression in  the knee can lead to a condition called foot drop, which makes walking,  climbing stairs, or driving difficult or impossible. html:p The symptoms of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies usually  begin during adolescence or early adulthood but may develop anytime from  childhood to late adulthood. Symptoms vary in severity; many people never  realize they have the disorder, while some people experience prolonged  disability. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies does not  affect life expectancy.

Name1: Hereditary pancreatitis
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-pancreatitis
frequency1: Hereditary pancreatitis is thought to be a rare condition. In Europe, its prevalence is estimated to be 3 to 6 per million individuals.
Description1: html:p Hereditary pancreatitis is a genetic condition characterized by recurrent  episodes of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). The pancreas produces  enzymes that help digest food, and it also produces insulin, a hormone that  controls blood sugar levels in the body. Episodes of pancreatitis can lead to  permanent tissue damage and loss of pancreatic function. html:p Signs and symptoms of this condition usually begin in late childhood with an  episode of acute pancreatitis. A sudden (acute) attack can cause abdominal pain,  fever, nausea, or vomiting. An episode typically lasts from one to three days,  although some people may experience severe episodes that last longer. Hereditary  pancreatitis progresses to recurrent acute pancreatitis with multiple episodes  of acute pancreatitis that recur over a period of at least a year; the number of  episodes a person experiences varies. Recurrent acute pancreatitis leads to  chronic pancreatitis, which occurs when the pancreas is persistently inflamed.  Chronic pancreatitis usually develops by early adulthood in affected  individuals. Signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis include occasional or  frequent abdominal pain of varying severity, flatulence, and bloating. Many  individuals with hereditary pancreatitis also develop abnormal calcium deposits  in the pancreas (pancreatic calcifications) by early adulthood. html:p Years of inflammation damage the pancreas, causing the formation of scar tissue  (fibrosis) in place of functioning pancreatic tissue. Pancreatic fibrosis leads  to the loss of pancreatic function in many affected individuals. This loss of  function can impair the production of digestive enzymes and disrupt normal  digestion, leading to fatty stool (steatorrhea), weight loss, and protein and  vitamin deficiencies. Because of a decrease in insulin production due to a loss  of pancreatic function, about a quarter of individuals with hereditary  pancreatitis will develop type 1 diabetes mellitus by mid-adulthood; the risk of  developing diabetes increases with age. html:p Chronic pancreatic inflammation and damage to the pancreas increase the risk of  developing pancreatic cancer. The risk is particularly high in people with  hereditary pancreatitis who also smoke, use alcohol, have type 1 diabetes  mellitus, or have a family history of cancer. In affected individuals who  develop pancreatic cancer, it is typically diagnosed in mid-adulthood. html:p Complications from pancreatic cancer and type 1 diabetes mellitus are the most  common causes of death in individuals with hereditary pancreatitis, although  individuals with this condition are thought to have a normal life expectancy.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma
frequency1: Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma occurs in approximately 1 in 1 million people.
Description1: html:p Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma is an inherited condition  characterized by the growth of noncancerous (benign) tumors in structures called  paraganglia. Paraganglia are groups of cells that are found near nerve cell  bunches called ganglia. A tumor involving the paraganglia is known as a  paraganglioma. A type of paraganglioma known as a pheochromocytoma develops in  the adrenal glands, which are located on top of each kidney and produce hormones  in response to stress. Other types of paraganglioma are usually found in the  head, neck, or trunk. People with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma  develop one or more paragangliomas, which may include pheochromocytomas. html:p Pheochromocytomas and some other paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of  the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system controls the  "fight-or-flight"response, a series of changes in the body due to hormones  released in response to stress. Sympathetic paragangliomas found outside the  adrenal glands, usually in the abdomen, are called extra-adrenal paragangliomas.  Most sympathetic paragangliomas, including pheochromocytomas, produce hormones  called catecholamines, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine. These  excess catecholamines can cause signs and symptoms such as high blood pressure  (hypertension), episodes of rapid heartbeat (palpitations), headaches, or  sweating. html:p Most paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of the parasympathetic nervous  system, which controls involuntary body functions such as digestion and saliva  formation. Parasympathetic paragangliomas, typically found in the head and neck,  usually do not produce hormones. However, large tumors may cause signs and  symptoms such as coughing, hearing loss in one ear, or difficulty swallowing. html:p Although most paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are noncancerous, some can  become cancerous (malignant) and spread to other parts of the body  (metastasize). Extra-adrenal paragangliomas become malignant more often than  other types of paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma. html:p Researchers have identified several types of hereditary  paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma. Each type is distinguished by its genetic cause.  People with types 1, 2, and 3 typically develop paragangliomas in the head or  neck region. People with type 4 usually develop extra-adrenal paragangliomas in  the abdomen and are at higher risk for malignant tumors that metastasize. The  other types are very rare. Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma is  typically diagnosed in a person's 30s. html:p Paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas can occur in individuals with other  inherited disorders, such as von-Hippel Lindau syndrome, Carney-Stratakis  syndrome, and certain types of multiple endocrine neoplasia. These other  disorders feature additional tumor types and have different genetic causes. Some  paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas occur in people with no history of the  tumors in their families and appear not to be inherited. These cases are  designated as sporadic.

Description1: html:p Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IE (HSAN IE) is a disorder that  affects the nervous system. It is characterized by three main features: hearing  loss, a decline of  function (dementia), and a worsening loss of  sensation in the feet and legs (peripheral neuropathy). html:p People with HSAN IE develop hearing loss that is caused by abnormalities in the  inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). The hearing loss, which affects both  ears, gets worse over time and usually progresses to moderate or severe deafness  between the ages of 20 and 35. html:p Affected individuals experience dementia typically beginning in their thirties.  In some people with HSAN IE, changes in personality, such as irritability,  apathy, or lack of impulse control, become apparent before problems with  thinking skills. html:p Peripheral neuropathy is caused by impaired function of nerve cells called  sensory neurons, which transmit information about sensations such as pain,  temperature, and touch. Loss of sensation in the feet and legs, which usually  begins in adolescence or early adulthood in people with HSAN IE and worsens over  time, can cause difficulty walking. Affected individuals may not be aware of  injuries to their feet, which can lead to complications such as open sores and  infections. If these complications are severe, amputation of the affected areas  may be required. html:p Some people with HSAN IE also experience recurrent  () and sleep  problems.

Description1: html:p Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSAN2) is a condition that  primarily affects the sensory nerve cells (sensory neurons), which transmit  information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch to the brain.  These sensations are impaired in people with HSAN2. In some affected people, the  condition may also cause mild abnormalities of the autonomic neurons, which  control involuntary body functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing.  The sensory and autonomic neurons are part of the body's peripheral nervous  system, which comprises the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. HSAN2 is  considered a form of peripheral neuropathy. html:p The signs and symptoms of HSAN2 typically begin in infancy or early childhood.  The first sign of the condition is usually numbness in the hands and feet. Soon  after, affected individuals lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold.  In people with HSAN2, unnoticed injuries often lead to open sores (ulcers) on  the hands and feet. Because affected individuals cannot feel the pain of these  sores, they may not seek treatment right away. Without treatment, the ulcers can  become infected and may require amputation of the affected area. People with  HSAN2 often injure themselves unintentionally, typically by biting the tongue,  lips, or fingers. These injuries may lead to loss of the affected areas, such as  the tip of the tongue. Affected individuals often have injuries and fractures  in their hands, feet, limbs, and joints that go untreated because of the  inability to feel pain. Repeated injury can lead to a condition called  . html:p The effects of HSAN2 on the autonomic nervous system are more variable. Some  infants with HSAN2 have digestive problems such as the backflow of stomach acids  into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) or slow eye-blink or gag reflexes.  Affected individuals may also have weak deep-tendon reflexes, such as the  reflex being tested when a doctor taps the knee with a hammer. html:p Some people with HSAN2 lose a type of taste bud on the tip of the tongue called  lingual fungiform papillae and have a diminished sense of taste.

Description1: html:p Hereditary spherocytosis is a condition that affects red blood cells. People  with this condition typically experience a shortage of red blood cells (anemia),  yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), and an enlarged spleen  (splenomegaly). Most newborns with hereditary spherocytosis have severe anemia,  although it improves after the first year of life. Splenomegaly can occur  anytime from early childhood to adulthood. About half of affected individuals  develop hard deposits in the gallbladder called gallstones, which typically  occur from late childhood to mid-adulthood. html:p There are four forms of hereditary spherocytosis, which are distinguished by the  severity of signs and symptoms. They are known as the mild form, the moderate  form, the moderate/severe form, and the severe form. It is estimated that 20 to  30 percent of people with hereditary spherocytosis have the mild form, 60 to 70  percent have the moderate form, 10 percent have the moderate/severe form, and 3  to 5 percent have the severe form. html:p People with the mild form may have very mild anemia or sometimes have no  symptoms. People with the moderate form typically have anemia, jaundice, and  splenomegaly. Many also develop gallstones. The signs and symptoms of moderate  hereditary spherocytosis usually appear in childhood. Individuals with the  moderate/severe form have all the features of the moderate form but also have  severe anemia. Those with the severe form have life-threatening anemia that  requires frequent blood transfusions to replenish their red blood cell supply.  They also have severe splenomegaly, jaundice, and a high risk for developing  gallstones. Some individuals with the severe form have , delayed

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-xanthinuria
frequency1: The combined incidence of hereditary xanthinuria types I and II is estimated to be about 1 in 69,000 people worldwide. However, researchers suspect that the true incidence may be higher because some affected individuals have no symptoms and are never diagnosed with the condition. Hereditary xanthinuria appears to be more common in people of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ancestry. About 150 cases of this condition have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Hereditary xanthinuria is a condition that most often affects the kidneys. It is  characterized by high levels of a compound called xanthine and very low levels  of another compound called uric acid in the blood and urine. The excess xanthine  can accumulate in the kidneys and other tissues. In the kidneys, xanthine forms  tiny crystals that occasionally build up to create kidney stones. These stones  can impair kidney function and ultimately cause kidney failure. Related signs  and symptoms can include abdominal pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, and  blood in the urine (hematuria). Less commonly, xanthine crystals build up in  the muscles, causing pain and cramping. In some people with hereditary  xanthinuria, the condition does not cause any health problems. html:p Researchers have described two major forms of hereditary xanthinuria, types I  and II. The types are distinguished by the enzymes involved; they have the same  signs and symptoms.

Type 1 is</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">more common in Puerto Rico, particularly in the northwestern part of the island</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">where about 1 in 1,800 people are affected. Type 3 is common in people from</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">central Puerto Rico. Groups of affected individuals have been identified in many</span> other regions, including India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe.
Description1: html:p Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a disorder characterized by a condition called  oculocutaneous albinism, which causes abnormally light coloring (pigmentation)  of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have fair skin and  white or light-colored hair. People with this disorder have a higher than  average risk of skin damage and skin cancers caused by long-term sun exposure.  Oculocutaneous albinism reduces pigmentation of the colored part of the eye  (iris) and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Reduced  vision, rapid and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and increased  sensitivity to light (photophobia) are also common in oculocutaneous albinism.  In Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, these vision problems usually remain stable after  early childhood. html:p People with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome also have problems with blood clotting  (coagulation) that lead to easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. html:p Some individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome develop breathing problems due  to a lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis, which causes scar tissue to form in  the lungs. The symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis usually appear during an  individual's early thirties and rapidly worsen. Individuals with  Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome who develop pulmonary fibrosis often do not live for  more than a decade after they begin to experience breathing problems. html:p Other, less common features of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome include inflammation of  the large intestine (granulomatous colitis) and kidney failure. html:p There are nine different types of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which can be  distinguished by their signs and symptoms and underlying genetic cause. Types 1  and 4 are the most severe forms of the disorder. Types 1, 2, and 4 are the only  types associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Individuals with type 3, 5, or 6 have  the mildest symptoms. Little is known about the signs, symptoms, and severity of  types 7, 8, and 9.

frequency1: The prevalence of heterotaxy syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 people worldwide. However, researchers suspect that the condition is underdiagnosed, and so it may actually be more common than this. Heterotaxy syndrome accounts for approximately 3 percent of all congenital s. For reasons that are unknown, the condition appears to be more common in Asian populations than in North America and Europe. Recent studies report that in the United States, the condition occurs more frequently in children born to black or Hispanic mothers than in children born to white mothers.
Description1: html:p Heterotaxy syndrome is a condition in which the internal organs are abnormally  arranged in the chest and abdomen. The term"heterotaxy"is from the Greek words  "heteros,"meaning"other than,"and"taxis,"meaning"arrangement."  Individuals with this condition have complex birth defects affecting the heart,  lungs, liver, spleen, intestines, and other organs. html:p In the normal body, most of the organs in the chest and abdomen have a  particular location on the right or left side. For example, the heart, spleen,  and pancreas are on the left side of the body, and most of the liver is on the  right. This normal arrangement of the organs is known as"situs solitus."  Rarely, the orientation of the internal organs is completely flipped from right  to left, a situation known as"situs inversus."This mirror-image orientation  usually does not cause any health problems, unless it occurs as part of a  syndrome affecting other parts of the body. Heterotaxy syndrome is an  arrangement of internal organs somewhere between situs solitus and situs  inversus; this condition is also known as"situs ambiguus."Unlike situs  inversus, the abnormal arrangement of organs in heterotaxy syndrome often causes  serious health problems. html:p Heterotaxy syndrome alters the structure of the heart, including the attachment  of the large blood vessels that carry blood to and from the rest of the body. It  can also affect the structure of the lungs, such as the number of lobes in each  lung and the length of the tubes (called bronchi) that lead from the windpipe  to the lungs. In the abdomen, the condition can cause a person to have no spleen  (asplenia) or multiple small, poorly functioning spleens (polysplenia). The  liver may lie across the middle of the body instead of being in its normal  position to the right of the stomach. Some affected individuals also have  intestinal malrotation, which is an abnormal twisting of the intestines that   html:p Depending on the organs involved, signs and symptoms of heterotaxy syndrome can  include a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis, which is due to a  shortage of oxygen), breathing difficulties, an increased risk of infections,  and problems with digesting food. The most serious complications are generally  caused by critical congenital heart disease, a group of complex s  that are present from birth. Biliary atresia, a problem with the bile ducts in  the liver, can also cause severe health problems in infancy. Heterotaxy syndrome  is often life-threatening in infancy or childhood, even with treatment,  although its severity depends on the specific abnormalities involved.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Hirschsprung disease is an intestinal disorder characterized by the absence of</span>  nerves in parts of the intestine. This condition occurs when the nerves in the  intestine (enteric nerves) do not form properly during development before birth  (embryonic development). This condition is usually identified in the first two  months of life, although less severe cases may be diagnosed later in childhood. html:p Enteric nerves trigger the muscle contractions that move stool through the  intestine. Without these nerves in parts of the intestine, the material cannot  be pushed through, causing severe constipation or complete blockage of the  intestine in people with Hirschsprung disease. Other signs and symptoms of this  condition include vomiting, abdominal pain or swelling, diarrhea, poor feeding,  malnutrition, and . People with this disorder are at risk of  developing more serious conditions such as inflammation of the intestine  (enterocolitis) or a hole in the wall of the intestine (intestinal perforation),  which can cause serious infection and may be fatal. html:p There are two main types of Hirschsprung disease, known as short-segment disease  and long-segment disease, which are defined by the region of the intestine  lacking nerve cells. In short-segment disease, nerve cells are missing from only  the last segment of the large intestine. This type is most common, occurring in  approximately 80 percent of people with Hirschsprung disease. For unknown  reasons, short-segment disease is four times more common in men than in women.  Long-segment disease occurs when nerve cells are missing from most of the large  intestine and is the more severe type. Long-segment disease is found in  approximately 20 percent of people with Hirschsprung disease and affects men and  women equally. Very rarely, nerve cells are missing from the entire large  intestine and sometimes part of the small intestine (total colonic  aganglionosis) or from all of the large and small intestine (total intestinal  aganglionosis). html:p Hirschsprung disease can occur in combination with other conditions, such as  Waardenburg syndrome, type IV; Mowat-Wilson syndrome; or congenital central  hypoventilation syndrome. These cases are described as syndromic. Hirschsprung  disease can also occur without other conditions, and these cases are referred to  as isolated or nonsyndromic.

Description1: html:p Holt-Oram syndrome is characterized by skeletal abnormalities of the hands and  arms (upper limbs) and heart problems. html:p People with Holt-Oram syndrome have abnormally developed bones in their upper  limbs. At least one abnormality in the bones of the wrist (carpal bones) is  present in affected individuals. Often, these wrist bone abnormalities can be  detected only by x-ray. Individuals with Holt-Oram syndrome may have additional  bone abnormalities including a missing thumb, a long thumb that looks like a  finger, partial or complete absence of bones in the forearm, an underdeveloped  bone of the upper arm, and abnormalities of the collar bone or shoulder blades.  These skeletal abnormalities may affect one or both of the upper limbs. If both  upper limbs are affected, the bone abnormalities can be the same or different on  each side. In cases where the skeletal abnormalities are not the same on both  sides of the body, the left side is usually more severely affected than the  right side. html:p About 75 percent of individuals with Holt-Oram syndrome have heart (cardiac)  problems, which can be life-threatening. The most common problem is a defect in  the muscular wall (septum) that separates the right and left sides of the heart.  A hole in the septum between the upper chambers of the heart (atria) is called  an atrial septal defect (), and a hole in the septum between the lower  chambers of the heart (ventricles) is called a ventricular septal defect ().  Some people with Holt-Oram syndrome have cardiac conduction disease, which is  caused by abnormalities in the electrical system that coordinates contractions  of the heart chambers. Cardiac conduction disease can lead to problems such as a  slower-than-normal heart rate (bradycardia) or a rapid and uncoordinated  contraction of the heart muscle (fibrillation). Cardiac conduction disease can  occur along with other s (such as or ) or as the only heart  problem in people with Holt-Oram syndrome. html:p The features of Holt-Oram syndrome are similar to those of a condition called  Duane-radial ray syndrome; however, these two disorders are caused by mutations  in different genes.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of</span>  cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is  produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals  (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). The body  needs this substance to build cell membranes, make certain hormones, and produce  compounds that aid in fat digestion. Too much cholesterol, however, increases a  person's risk of developing heart disease. html:p People with hypercholesterolemia have a high risk of developing a form of heart  disease called coronary artery disease. This condition occurs when excess  cholesterol in the bloodstream is deposited in the walls of blood vessels,  particularly in the arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries).  The abnormal buildup of cholesterol forms clumps (plaque) that narrow and  harden artery walls. As the clumps get bigger, they can clog the arteries and  restrict the flow of blood to the heart. The buildup of plaque in coronary  arteries causes a form of chest pain called angina and greatly increases a  person's risk of having a heart attack. html:p Inherited forms of hypercholesterolemia can also cause health problems related  to the buildup of excess cholesterol in other tissues. If cholesterol  accumulates in tendons, it causes characteristic growths called tendon  xanthomas. These growths most often affect the Achilles tendons and tendons in  the hands and fingers. Yellowish cholesterol deposits under the skin of the  eyelids are known as xanthelasmata. Cholesterol can also accumulate at the  edges of the clear, front surface of the eye (the cornea), leading to a  gray-colored ring called an arcus cornealis.

Description1: html:p Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is a disorder characterized by an excess of  an iron storage protein called ferritin in the blood (hyperferritinemia) and  tissues of the body. A buildup of this protein begins early in life, leading to  clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts). In affected individuals,  cataracts usually develop in infancy, rather than after age 60 as typically  occurs in the general population. Cataracts that are not removed surgically  cause progressive dimming and blurriness of vision because the clouded lenses  reduce and distort incoming light. html:p Although the hyperferritinemia in this disorder does not usually cause any  health problems other than cataracts, the elevated ferritin levels in the blood  can be mistaken for a sign of certain liver disorders. These conditions result  in excess iron in the body and may be treated by blood-drawing. However,  individuals with hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome do not have an excess of  iron, and with repeated blood draws will develop reduced iron levels leading to  a low number of red blood cells (anemia). Therefore, correct diagnosis of  hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is important to avoid unnecessary treatments  or invasive test procedures such as liver biopsies.

frequency1: Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis affects an estimated 1 in 200,000 people.
Description1: html:p Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a condition that causes episodes of extreme  muscle weakness or paralysis, usually beginning in infancy or early childhood.  Most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the  arms and legs. Episodes tend to increase in frequency until mid-adulthood, after  which they occur less frequently. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest  after exercise, potassium-rich foods such as bananas and potatoes, stress,  fatigue, alcohol, pregnancy, exposure to cold temperatures, certain medications,  and periods without food (fasting). Muscle strength usually returns to normal  between attacks, although many affected people continue to experience mild  stiffness (myotonia), particularly in muscles of the face and hands. html:p Most people with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis have increased levels of  potassium in their blood (hyperkalemia) during attacks. Hyperkalemia results  when the weak or paralyzed muscles release potassium ions into the bloodstream.  In other cases, attacks are associated with normal blood potassium levels  (normokalemia). Ingesting potassium can trigger attacks in affected individuals,  even if blood potassium levels do not go up.

Description1: html:p Hypermanganesemia with is an inherited disorder in which excessive  amounts of the element manganese accumulate in the body (hypermanganesemia). One  place manganese builds up in particular is in a region of the brain responsible  for the coordination of movement, causing neurological problems that make  controlling movement difficult. Consequently, the condition is characterized by  involuntary, sustained  and other uncontrolled  movements. Two types of hypermanganesemia with , called  hypermanganesemia with, polycythemia, and cirrhosis (HMDPC) and  hypermanganesemia with , have been identified. They are distinguished  by their genetic causes and certain specific features. html:p In HMDPC (also known as hypermanganesemia with dystonia 1), manganese  accumulates in the blood, brain, and liver. Signs and symptoms of the condition  can begin in childhood (early-onset), typically between ages 2 and 15, or in  adulthood (adult-onset). Most children with the early-onset form of HMDPC  experience in the arms and legs, which often leads to a characteristic  high-stepping walk described as a"cock-walk gait."Other neurological symptoms  in affected children include involuntary  (), unusually slow  movement (bradykinesia), and slurred  (). The adult-onset form  of HMDPC is characterized by a pattern of movement abnormalities known as  parkinsonism, which includes bradykinesia, , muscle rigidity, and an  inability to hold the body upright and balanced (postural instability). html:p Individuals with HMDPC have an increased number of red blood cells  (polycythemia) and low levels of iron stored in the body. Additional features of  HMDPC can include an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) due to manganese  accumulation in the organ, scarring (fibrosis) in the liver, and irreversible  liver disease (cirrhosis). html:p In hypermanganesemia with , manganese accumulates in the blood and  brain. Signs and symptoms of this type of the disorder usually begin between  ages 6 months and 3 years.  . can  affect any part of the body and worsens over time.

frequency1: The exact prevalence of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome is unknown. Approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome is a condition characterized by  overactivity of the parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism). The four  parathyroid glands are located in the neck and secrete a hormone that regulates  the body's use of calcium. Hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of  calcium in the blood, which can lead to kidney stones, thinning of the bones  (osteoporosis), nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness,  and fatigue. html:p In people with hyperthyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, hyperparathyroidism is caused  by tumors that form in the parathyroid glands. Typically only one of the four  parathyroid glands is affected, but in some people, tumors are found in more  than one gland. The tumors are usually noncancerous (benign), in which case  they are called adenomas. Approximately 15 percent of people with  hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome develop a cancerous tumor called  parathyroid carcinoma. People with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome may  also have a type of benign tumor called a fibroma in the jaw. Even though jaw  tumors are specified in the name of this condition, it is estimated that only 25  to 50 percent of affected individuals have this symptom. html:p Other tumors, both benign and cancerous, are often seen in  hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. For example, tumors of the uterus occur  in about 75 percent of women with this condition. The kidneys are affected in  about 20 percent of people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Benign  kidney cysts are the most common kidney feature, but a rare tumor called Wilms  tumor and other types of kidney tumor have also been found.

Description1: html:p Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC) is a condition  characterized by an increase in the levels of phosphate in the blood  (hyperphosphatemia) and abnormal deposits of phosphate and calcium (calcinosis)  in the body's tissues. Calcinosis typically develops in early childhood to early  adulthood, although in some people the deposits first appear in infancy or in  late adulthood. Calcinosis usually occurs in and just under skin tissue around  the joints, most often the hips, shoulders, and elbows. Calcinosis may also  develop in the soft tissue of the feet, legs, and hands. Rarely, calcinosis  occurs in blood vessels or in the brain and can cause serious health problems.  The deposits develop over time and vary in size. Larger deposits form masses  that are noticeable under the skin and can  . These large deposits may appear tumor-like (tumoral), but  they are not tumors or cancerous. The number and frequency of deposits varies  among affected individuals; some develop few deposits during their lifetime,  while others may develop many in a short period of time. html:p Other features of HFTC include eye abnormalities such as calcium buildup in the  clear front covering of the eye (corneal calcification) or angioid streaks that  occur when tiny breaks form in the layer of tissue at the back of the eye called  Bruch's membrane. Inflammation of the long bones (diaphysis) or excessive bone  growth (hyperostosis) may occur. Some affected individuals have dental  abnormalities. In males, small crystals of cholesterol can accumulate  (microlithiasis) in the testicles, which usually causes no health problems. html:p A similar condition called hyperphosphatemia-hyperostosis syndrome (HHS) results  in increased levels of phosphate in the blood, excessive bone growth, and bone  lesions. This condition used to be considered a separate disorder, but it is now  thought to be a mild variant of HFTC.

This condition generally occurs when  proline is not broken down properly by the body. There are two inherited forms  of hyperprolinemia, called type I and type II. html:p People with hyperprolinemia type I often do not show any symptoms, although they  have proline levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level.  Some individuals with hyperprolinemia type I exhibit ,  disability, or other neurological or  problems. html:p Hyperprolinemia type II results in proline levels in the blood between 10 and 15  times higher than normal, and high levels of a related compound called  pyrroline-5-carboxylate. This form of the disorder has signs and symptoms that  vary in severity, and is more likely than type I to involve  or  disability. html:p Hyperprolinemia can also occur with other conditions, such as malnutrition or  liver disease. In particular, individuals with conditions that cause elevated  levels of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidemia) may have hyperprolinemia as  well, because lactic acid inhibits the breakdown of proline.

frequency1: Although its exact prevalence is unknown, hypokalemic periodic paralysis is estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 people. Men tend to experience symptoms of this condition more often than women.
Description1: html:p Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a condition that causes episodes of extreme  muscle weakness typically beginning in childhood or adolescence. Most often,  these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and  legs. Attacks cause severe weakness or paralysis that usually lasts from hours  to days. Some people may have episodes almost every day, while others  experience them weekly, monthly, or only rarely. Attacks can occur without  warning or can be triggered by factors such as rest after exercise, a viral  illness, or certain medications. Often, a large, carbohydrate-rich meal or  vigorous exercise in the evening can trigger an attack upon waking the following  morning. Although affected individuals usually regain their muscle strength  between attacks, repeated episodes can lead to persistent muscle weakness later  in life. html:p People with hypokalemic periodic paralysis have reduced levels of potassium in  their blood (hypokalemia) during episodes of muscle weakness. Researchers are  investigating how low potassium levels may be related to the muscle  abnormalities in this condition.

Description1: html:p Hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia is an inherited condition caused by  the body's inability to absorb and retain magnesium that is taken in through the  diet. As a result, magnesium levels in the blood are severely low  (hypomagnesemia). html:p Hypomagnesemia impairs the function of the parathyroid glands, which are small  hormone-producing glands located in the neck. Normally, the parathyroid glands  release a hormone that increases blood calcium levels when they are low.  Magnesium is required for the production and release of parathyroid hormone, so  when magnesium is too low, insufficient parathyroid hormone is produced and  blood calcium levels are also reduced (hypocalcemia). The hypocalcemia is  described as"secondary"because it occurs as a consequence of hypomagnesemia. html:p Shortages of magnesium and calcium can cause neurological problems that begin in  infancy, including painful muscle spasms (tetany) and . If left  untreated, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia can lead to  , a failure to gain weight and grow at the  expected rate (failure to thrive), and heart failure.

Description1: html:p Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is an inherited condition that affects  the nervous system and the eyes. This disease is one of a group of genetic  disorders called leukoencephalopathies. Leukoencephalopathies involve  abnormalities of the brain's white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers  covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve fibers and  promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. Hypomyelination and  congenital cataract is caused by a reduced ability to form myelin  (hypomyelination). Additionally, people with this disorder are typically born  with a clouding of the lens (cataract) in both eyes. html:p People with this condition usually have normal development throughout the first  year of life. Development slows around the age of 1. Most affected children  learn to walk between the ages of 1 and 2, although they usually need some type  of support. Over time they experience  and in  their legs, and many affected people eventually require wheelchair assistance.  Weakness in the muscles of the trunk and a progressive abnormal curvature of the  spine (scoliosis) further impair walking in some individuals. Most people with  hypomyelination and congenital cataract have reduced sensation in their arms  and legs (peripheral neuropathy). In addition, affected individuals typically  have  difficulties () and mild to moderate  disability.

Description1: html:p Hypophosphatasia is an inherited disorder that affects the  . This condition disrupts a process called mineralization, in which  minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in developing bones and  teeth. Mineralization is critical for the formation of bones that are strong  and rigid and teeth that can withstand chewing and grinding. html:p The signs and symptoms of hypophosphatasia vary widely and can appear anywhere  from before birth to adulthood. The most severe forms of the disorder tend to  occur before birth and in early infancy. Hypophosphatasia weakens and softens  the bones, causing skeletal abnormalities similar to another childhood bone  disorder called rickets. Affected infants are born with short limbs, an  abnormally shaped chest, and soft skull bones. Additional complications in  infancy include poor feeding and a failure to gain weight, respiratory problems,  and high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), which can lead to  recurrent vomiting and kidney problems. These complications are  life-threatening in some cases. html:p The forms of hypophosphatasia that appear in childhood or adulthood are  typically less severe than those that appear in infancy. Early loss of primary  (baby) teeth is one of the first signs of the condition in children. Affected  children may have  with bowed legs or knock knees,  , and an abnormal skull shape. Adult forms of hypophosphatasia  are characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia. In adults,  recurrent fractures in the foot and thigh bones can lead to chronic pain.  Affected adults may lose their secondary (adult) teeth prematurely and are at  increased risk for joint pain and inflammation. html:p The mildest form of this condition, called odontohypophosphatasia, only affects  the teeth. People with this disorder typically experience  , but do not have the skeletal abnormalities  seen in other forms of hypophosphatasia.

Description1: html:p Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia is a condition characterized by high levels  of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). Two types of idiopathic infantile  hypercalcemia have been identified and are distinguished by their genetic  causes: infantile hypercalcemia 1 and infantile hypercalcemia 2. In infants with  either type, hypercalcemia can cause vomiting, increased urine production  (polyuria), dehydration, constipation, poor feeding, weight loss, and an  inability to grow and gain weight as expected (failure to thrive). As they age,  affected babies usually have  . Individuals with infantile hypercalcemia 1 or 2  may also have high levels of calcium in their urine (hypercalciuria) and  deposits of calcium in their kidneys (nephrocalcinosis). html:p With treatment, the outward symptoms of hypercalcemia, such as vomiting,  dehydration, failure to thrive, and psychomotor delay, usually improve in  childhood. However, affected children still tend to have higher-than-normal  amounts of calcium in their blood and urine and calcium deposits in their  kidneys. By adulthood, long-term hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria can lead to  the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) and may damage the kidneys and  impair their function. Affected adults may also develop  or in the clear outer covering of the eye (the cornea), and some have low  bone mineral density (osteoporosis). html:p In rare cases, affected individuals do not have symptoms of hypercalcemia in  infancy, and the condition begins in later childhood or adulthood. These  individuals usually develop hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and  nephrolithiasis, although the features may not cause any obvious health  problems. html:p Although most signs and symptoms are similar between the two known types of  idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia, individuals with infantile hypercalcemia 2  have low levels of a mineral called phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia),  while phosphate levels are typically normal in people with infantile  hypercalcemia 1.

Only a small percentage of cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis appear to run in families.
Description1: html:p Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease. This  condition causes scar tissue (fibrosis) to build up in the lungs, which makes  the lungs unable to transport oxygen into the bloodstream effectively. The  disease usually affects people between the ages of 50 and 70. html:p The most common signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are  shortness of breath and a persistent dry, hacking cough. Many affected  individuals also experience a loss of appetite and gradual weight loss. Some  people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis develop widened and rounded tips of  the fingers and toes (clubbing) resulting from a shortage of oxygen. These  features are relatively nonspecific; not everyone with these health problems has  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Other respiratory diseases, some of which are  less serious, can cause similar signs and symptoms. html:p In people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, scarring of the lungs increases  over time until the lungs can no longer provide enough oxygen to the body's  organs and tissues. Some people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis develop other  serious lung conditions, including lung cancer, blood clots in the lungs  (pulmonary emboli), pneumonia, or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that  supply the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Most affected individuals survive 3  to 5 years after their diagnosis. However, the course of the disease is highly  variable; some affected people become seriously ill within a few months, while  others may live with the disease for a decade or longer. html:p In most cases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs in only one person in a  family. These cases are described as sporadic. However, a small percentage of  people with this disease have at least one other affected family member. When  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs in multiple members of the same family, it  is known as familial pulmonary fibrosis.

frequency1: IPEX syndrome is a rare disorder that affects an estimated 1 in 1.6 million people.
Description1: html:p Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome  primarily affects males and is caused by problems with the immune system. The  immune system normally protects the body from foreign invaders, such as bacteria  and viruses, by recognizing and attacking these invaders and clearing them from  the body. However, the immune system can malfunction and attack the body's own  tissues and organs instead, which is known as autoimmunity. IPEX syndrome is  characterized by the development of multiple autoimmune disorders in affected  individuals. Although IPEX syndrome can affect many different areas of the body,  autoimmune disorders involving the intestines, skin, and hormone-producing  (endocrine) glands occur most often. IPEX syndrome can be life-threatening in  early childhood. html:p Almost all individuals with IPEX syndrome develop a disorder of the intestines  called autoimmune enteropathy. Autoimmune enteropathy occurs when certain cells  in the intestines are destroyed by a person's immune system. It causes severe  diarrhea, which is usually the first symptom of IPEX syndrome. Autoimmune  enteropathy typically begins in the first few months of life. It can cause  failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and  general wasting and weight loss (cachexia). html:p People with IPEX syndrome frequently develop inflammation of the skin, called  dermatitis. Eczema is the most common type of dermatitis that occurs in this  syndrome, and it causes abnormal patches of red, irritated skin. Other skin  disorders that cause similar symptoms are sometimes present in IPEX syndrome. html:p The term polyendocrinopathy is used in IPEX syndrome because individuals can  develop multiple disorders of the endocrine glands. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is  an autoimmune condition involving the pancreas and is the most common endocrine  disorder present in people with IPEX syndrome. It usually develops within the  first few months of life and prevents the body from properly controlling the  amount of sugar in the blood. Autoimmune thyroid disease may also develop in  people with IPEX syndrome. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ in the  lower neck that produces hormones. This gland is commonly underactive  (hypothyroidism) in individuals with this disorder, but may become overactive  (hyperthyroidism). html:p Individuals with IPEX syndrome typically develop other types of autoimmune  disorders in addition to those that involve the intestines, skin, and endocrine  glands. Autoimmune blood disorders are common; about half of affected  individuals have low levels of red blood cells (anemia), platelets  (thrombocytopenia), or certain white blood cells (neutropenia) because these  cells are attacked by the immune system. In some individuals, IPEX syndrome  involves the liver and kidneys.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/immune-thrombocytopenia
frequency1: The incidence of immune thrombocytopenia is approximately 4 per 100,000 children and 3 per 100,000 adults. In adults with immune thrombocytopenia, women are affected more often than men.It is likely that this condition is underdiagnosed because those with mild signs and symptoms often do not seek medical attention.
Description1: html:p Immune thrombocytopenia is a disorder characterized by a blood abnormality  called thrombocytopenia, which is a shortage of blood cell fragments called  platelets that are needed for normal blood clotting. html:p Affected individuals can develop red or purple spots on the skin caused by  bleeding just under the skin's surface. Small spots of bleeding under the skin  are called purpura and larger spots are called ecchymoses. People with immune  thrombocytopenia can have significant bleeding episodes, such as nose bleeds  (epistaxis) or bleeding in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth. In severe  cases, individuals may have gastrointestinal bleeding or blood in the urine or  stool, or heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). In very rare  instances, bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) can occur, which  can be life-threatening. A greater reduction in platelet numbers is often  associated with more frequent bleeding episodes and an increased risk of severe  bleeding. html:p While immune thrombocytopenia can be diagnosed at any age, there are two periods  when the condition is most likely to develop: early childhood and late  adulthood. In children, the reduction in platelets is often sudden, but platelet  levels usually return to normal levels within weeks to months. Immune  thrombocytopenia in children is often preceded by a minor infection, such as an  upper respiratory infection, but the relationship between the infection and  immune thrombocytopenia is not clear. In adults, the development of immune  thrombocytopenia is usually gradual and the condition tends to persist  throughout life.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/inclusion-body-myopathy-2
frequency1: More than 200 people with inclusion body myopathy 2 have been reported. Most are of Iranian Jewish descent; the condition affects an estimated 1 in 1,500 people in this population. Additionally, at least 15 people in the Japanese population have been diagnosed with this disorder. Inclusion body myopathy 2 has also been found in several other ethnic groups worldwide.
Description1: html:p Inclusion body myopathy 2 is a condition that primarily affects skeletal  muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. This disorder causes  muscle weakness that appears in late adolescence or early adulthood and  worsens over time. html:p The first sign of inclusion body myopathy 2 is weakness of a muscle in the lower  leg called the tibialis anterior. This muscle helps control up-and-down  movement of the foot. Weakness in the tibialis anterior alters the way a person  walks and makes it difficult to run and climb stairs. As the disorder  progresses, weakness also develops in muscles of the upper legs, hips,  shoulders, and hands. Unlike most forms of myopathy, inclusion body myopathy 2  usually does not affect the quadriceps, which are a group of large muscles at  the front of the thigh. This condition also does not affect muscles of the eye  or heart, and it does not cause neurological problems. Weakness in leg muscles  makes walking increasingly difficult, and most people with inclusion body  myopathy 2 require wheelchair assistance within 20 years after signs and  symptoms appear. html:p People with the characteristic features of inclusion body myopathy 2 have been  described in several different populations. When the condition was first  reported in Japanese families, researchers called it distal myopathy with rimmed  vacuoles (DMRV) or Nonaka myopathy. When a similar disorder was discovered in  Iranian Jewish families, researchers called it rimmed vacuole myopathy or  hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). It has since become clear that these  conditions are variations of a single disorder caused by mutations in the same  gene.

Description1: dementia (IBMPFD) is a condition that can affect the muscles, bones, and brain. html:p The first symptom of IBMPFD is often muscle weakness (myopathy), which typically  appears in mid-adulthood. Weakness first occurs in muscles of the hips and  shoulders, making it difficult to climb stairs and raise the arms above the  shoulders. As the disorder progresses, weakness develops in other muscles in  the arms and legs. Muscle weakness can also affect respiratory and heart  (cardiac) muscles, leading to life-threatening breathing difficulties and heart  failure. html:p About half of all adults with IBMPFD develop a disorder called Paget disease of  bone. This disorder most often affects bones of the hips, spine, and skull, and  the long bones of the arms and legs. Bone pain, particularly in the hips and  spine, is usually the major symptom of Paget disease. Rarely, this condition  can weaken bones so much that they break (fracture). html:p In about one-third of people with IBMPFD, the disorder also affects the brain.  IBMPFD is associated with a brain condition called frontotemporal dementia,  which becomes noticeable in a person's forties or fifties. Frontotemporal  dementia progressively damages parts of the brain that control reasoning,  personality,  skills, , and . People with this condition  initially may have trouble speaking, remembering words and names (dysnomia), and  using numbers (dyscalculia). Personality changes, a loss of judgment, and  inappropriate  behavior are also hallmarks of the disease. As the  dementia worsens, affected people ultimately become unable to speak, read, or  care for themselves. html:p People with IBMPFD usually live into their fifties or sixties.

frequency1: Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis is a rare disorder, with at least 30 cases reported in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis is one of a group of  genetic disorders known as hereditary spastic paraplegias. These disorders are  characterized by progressive  and eventual  paralysis of the lower limbs (paraplegia). The and paraplegia result  from degeneration (atrophy) of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells  in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. Hereditary spastic  paraplegias are divided into two types: pure and complicated. The pure types  involve only the lower limbs, while the complicated types involve additional  areas of the nervous system, affecting the upper limbs and other areas of the  body. Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis starts as a pure  hereditary spastic paraplegia, with and weakness in the legs only,  but as the disorder progresses, the muscles in the arms, neck, and head become  involved and features of the disorder are more characteristic of the complicated  type. html:p Affected infants are typically normal at birth, then within the first 2 years of  life, the initial symptoms of infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic  paralysis appear. Early symptoms include exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia)  and recurrent muscle spasms in the legs. As the condition progresses, affected  children develop abnormal tightness and stiffness in the leg muscles and  weakness in the legs and arms. Over time, muscle weakness and stiffness travels  up (ascends) the body from the legs to the head and neck. Muscles in the head  and neck usually weaken during adolescence; symptoms include slow eye movements  and difficulty with  and swallowing. Affected individuals may lose the  ability to speak (anarthria). The leg and arm muscle weakness can become so  severe as to lead to paralysis; as a result affected individuals require  wheelchair assistance by late childhood or early adolescence. Intelligence is  not affected in this condition. html:p A condition called juvenile primary lateral sclerosis shares many of the  features of infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis. Both  conditions have the same genetic cause and significantly impair movement  beginning in childhood; however, the pattern of nerve degeneration is different.  Because of their similarities, these conditions are sometimes considered the  same disorder.

Description1: html:p Inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency is a genetic condition that  typically does not cause any health problems. html:p Thyroxine-binding globulin is a protein that carries hormones made or used by  the thyroid gland, which is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. Thyroid  hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and  the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Most of the time,  these hormones circulate in the bloodstream attached to thyroxine-binding  globulin and similar proteins. If there is a shortage (deficiency) of  thyroxine-binding globulin, the amount of circulating thyroid hormones is  reduced. html:p Researchers have identified two forms of inherited thyroxine-binding globulin  deficiency: the complete form (TBG-CD), which results in a total loss of  thyroxine-binding globulin, and the partial form (TBG-PD), which reduces the  amount of this protein or alters its structure. Neither of these conditions  causes any problems with thyroid function. They are usually identified during  routine blood tests that measure thyroid hormones. html:p Although inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency does not cause any  health problems, it can be mistaken for more serious thyroid disorders (such as  hypothyroidism). Therefore, it is important to diagnose inherited  thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency to avoid unnecessary treatments.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Intervertebral disc disease is a common condition characterized by the breakdown</span>  (degeneration) of one or more of the discs that separate the bones of the spine  (vertebrae), causing pain in the back or neck and frequently in the legs and  arms. The intervertebral discs provide cushioning between vertebrae and absorb  pressure put on the spine. html:p While the discs in the lower (lumbar) region of the spine are most often  affected in intervertebral disc disease, any part of the spine can have disc  degeneration. Depending on the location of the affected disc or discs,  intervertebral disc disease can cause periodic or chronic pain in the back or  neck. Pain is often worse when sitting, bending, twisting, or lifting objects. html:p Degenerated discs are prone to out-pouching (herniation); the protruding disc  can press against one of the spinal nerves that run from the spinal cord to the  rest of the body. This pressure causes pain, weakness, and numbness in the back  and legs. Herniated discs often cause nerve pain called sciatica that travels  along the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down the length of each  leg. html:p As a disc degenerates, small bony outgrowths (bone spurs) may form at the edges  of the affected vertebrae. These bone spurs may pinch (compress) the spinal  nerves, leading to weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. If the bone spurs  compress the spinal cord, affected individuals can develop problems with walking  and bladder and bowel control.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/intestinal-pseudo-obstruction
frequency1: The overall prevalence of intestinal pseudo-obstruction is unknown. Researchers in Japan have estimated the prevalence of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction in that country as 9 cases per million people.
Description1: html:p Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition characterized by impairment of the  muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. It can occur at  any time of life, and its symptoms range from mild to severe. The condition may  arise from abnormalities of the gastrointestinal muscles themselves (myogenic)  or from problems with the nerves that control the muscle contractions  (neurogenic). html:p Intestinal pseudo-obstruction leads to a buildup of partially digested food in  the intestines. This buildup can cause abdominal swelling (distention) and pain,  nausea, vomiting, and constipation or diarrhea. Affected individuals experience  loss of appetite and impaired ability to absorb nutrients, which may lead to  malnutrition. These symptoms resemble those of an intestinal blockage  (obstruction), but in intestinal pseudo-obstruction no blockage is found. html:p Depending on the cause of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, affected individuals  can have additional signs and symptoms. Some people with intestinal  pseudo-obstruction have bladder dysfunction such as an inability to pass urine.  Other features may include decreased muscle tone () or  of the torso and limbs, weakness in the muscles that control eye  movement (ophthalmoplegia),  disability, , unusual facial  features, or recurrent infections. html:p When intestinal pseudo-obstruction occurs by itself, it is called primary or  idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The disorder can also develop as a  complication of another health problem; in these cases, it is called secondary  intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The condition can be episodic (acute) or  persistent (chronic).

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is estimated to affect 1 percent of</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">women of Northern European ancestry. The condition is more common in certain</span> populations, such as women of Araucanian Indian ancestry in Chile or women of Scandinavian ancestry. This condition is found less frequently in other populations.
Description1: html:p Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver disorder that occurs in  pregnant women. Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of a  digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. As a result, bile builds up in the  liver, impairing liver function. Because the problems with bile release occur  within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition is described as intrahepatic  cholestasis. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually becomes apparent in  the third trimester of pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery of  the baby, and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear. However, they  can return during later pregnancies. html:p This condition causes severe itchiness (pruritus) in the expectant mother. The  itchiness usually begins on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and  then spreads to other parts of the body. Occasionally, affected women have  yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Some studies have shown  that women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are more likely to  develop gallstones sometime in their life than women who do not have the  condition. html:p Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can cause problems for the unborn baby.  This condition is associated with an increased risk of premature delivery and  stillbirth. Additionally, some infants born to mothers with intrahepatic  cholestasis of pregnancy have a slow heart rate and a lack of oxygen during  delivery (fetal distress).

Description1: html:p Isolated ectopia lentis is a condition that affects the eyes, specifically the  positioning of the lens. The lens is a clear structure at the front of the eye  that helps focus light. In people with isolated ectopia lentis, the lens in one  or both eyes is not centrally positioned as it should be but is off-center  (displaced). Isolated ectopia lentis usually becomes apparent in childhood. The  lens may drift further off-center over time. html:p Vision problems are common in isolated ectopia lentis. Affected individuals  often have nearsightedness (myopia) and can have an irregular curvature of the  lens or a structure that covers the front of the eye (the cornea), which causes  blurred vision (astigmatism). They may also develop clouding of the lenses  (cataracts) or increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) at an earlier age than  other adults. In a small number of people with isolated ectopia lentis, tearing  of the back lining of the eye (retinal detachment) occurs, which can lead to  further vision problems and possible blindness. html:p In individuals with isolated ectopia lentis, each eye can be affected  differently. In addition, the eye problems vary among affected individuals, even  those within the same family. html:p Ectopia lentis is classified as isolated when it occurs alone without signs and  symptoms affecting other body systems. Ectopia lentis can also be classified as  syndromic, when it is part of a syndrome that affects multiple parts of the  body. Ectopia lentis is a common feature of genetic syndromes such as Marfan  syndrome and Weill-Marchesani syndrome.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Isolated growth hormone deficiency is a condition caused by a severe shortage or</span>  absence of growth hormone. Growth hormone is a protein that is necessary for  the normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. Because they do not have  enough of this hormone, people with isolated growth hormone deficiency commonly  experience a failure to grow at the expected rate and have unusually  . This condition is usually apparent by early childhood. html:p There are four types of isolated growth hormone deficiency differentiated by the  severity of the condition, the gene involved, and the inheritance pattern. html:p Isolated growth hormone deficiency type IA is caused by an absence of growth  hormone and is the most severe of all the types. In people with type IA, growth  failure is evident in infancy as affected babies are shorter than normal at  birth. html:p People with isolated growth hormone deficiency type IB produce very low levels  of growth hormone. As a result, type IB is characterized by , but  this is typically not as severe as in type IA. Growth failure in  people with type IB is usually apparent in early to mid-childhood. html:p Individuals with isolated growth hormone deficiency type II have very low levels  of growth hormone and  that varies in severity.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/isolated-hyperchlorhidrosis
frequency1: Isolated hyperchlorhidrosis is a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown. The condition has been found mostly in the Bedouin population of southern Israel.
Description1: html:p Isolated hyperchlorhidrosis is characterized by the excessive loss of salt  (sodium chloride or NaCl) in sweat. In particular,"hyperchlorhidrosis"refers  to the high levels of chloride found in sweat, although both sodium and chloride  are released. Because the salt is abnormally released from the body in sweat,  there are lower than normal levels of sodium in fluids inside the body  (hyponatremia). Most infants with isolated hyperchlorhidrosis experience one or  more episodes of dehydration with low levels of sodium in the blood  (hyponatremic dehydration), which can require hospitalization. These episodes  typically follow a mild illness that causes vomiting or diarrhea. Affected  infants also have poor feeding and an inability to grow and gain weight at the  expected rate (failure to thrive). By early childhood, though, weight and height  usually catch up to normal, although the abnormal loss of salt still remains.  These individuals may still experience dangerous hyponatremia when they sweat  excessively, for example in warm temperatures or when exercising. html:p While hyperchlorhidrosis can occur as one of several features of other  conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, people with isolated hyperchlorhidrosis do  not have the additional signs and symptoms of these other conditions.

frequency1: ILS affects approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns.
Description1: html:p Isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS) is a condition that affects brain  development before birth. Normally, the cells that make up the exterior of the  brain (cerebral cortex) are well-organized, multi-layered, and arranged into  many folds and grooves (gyri). In people with ILS, the cells of the cerebral  cortex are disorganized, and the brain surface is abnormally smooth with an  absence (agyria) or reduction (pachygyria) of folds and grooves. In most cases,  these abnormalities impair brain growth, causing the brain to be smaller than  normal (microcephaly). This causes severe  , and recurrent  ()  in individuals with ILS. html:p More than 90 percent of individuals with ILS develop , often within the  first year of life. Up to 80 percent of infants with ILS have a type of seizure  called infantile spasms, these  can be severe enough to cause brain  dysfunction (epileptic encephalopathy). After the first months of life, most  children with ILS develop a variety of seizure types, including persisting  infantile spasms, short periods of loss of consciousness (absence );  sudden episodes of  (drop attacks); rapid, uncontrolled muscle  jerks (myoclonic ); and episodes of muscle rigidity, convulsions, and  loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic ). html:p Infants with ILS may have poor muscle tone () and difficulty feeding,  which leads to .  also affects the muscles used for  breathing, which often causes breathing problems that can lead to a  life-threatening bacterial lung infection known as aspiration pneumonia.  Children with ILS often develop in their arms and  legs and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Rarely,  the muscle stiffness will progress to paralysis (spastic paraplegia).  Individuals with ILS cannot walk and rarely crawl. Most children with ILS do not  develop  skills.

Description1: html:p Pierre Robin sequence is a set of abnormalities affecting the head and face,  consisting of a small lower jaw (micrognathia), a tongue that is placed further  back than normal (glossoptosis), and blockage (obstruction) of the airways. Most  people with Pierre Robin sequence are also born with an opening in the roof of  the mouth (a cleft palate). This feature is not generally considered necessary  for diagnosis of the condition, although there is some disagreement among  doctors. html:p Some people have the features of Pierre Robin sequence as part of a syndrome  that affects other organs and tissues in the body, such as Stickler syndrome or  campomelic dysplasia. These instances are described as syndromic. When Pierre  Robin sequence occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic or isolated.  Approximately 20 to 40 percent of cases of Pierre Robin sequence are isolated. html:p This condition is described as a"sequence"because one of its features,  , sets off a sequence of events  before birth that cause the other signs and symptoms. Specifically, having an  abnormally small jaw affects placement of the tongue, and the abnormally  positioned tongue can block the airways. In addition, micrognathia and  glossoptosis affect formation of the palate during development before birth,  which often leads to cleft palate. html:p The combination of features characteristic of Pierre Robin sequence can lead to  difficulty breathing and problems eating early in life. As a result, some  affected babies have an and gain weight at the expected rate  (failure to thrive).

Description1: html:p Isovaleric acidemia is a rare disorder in which the body is unable to process  certain proteins properly. It is classified as an organic acid disorder, which  is a condition that leads to an abnormal buildup of particular acids known as  organic acids. Abnormal levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia),  urine (organic aciduria), and tissues can be toxic and can cause serious health  problems. html:p Normally, the body breaks down proteins from food into smaller parts called  amino acids. Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for  and development. People with isovaleric acidemia have inadequate levels of an  enzyme that helps break down a particular amino acid called leucine. html:p Health problems related to isovaleric acidemia range from very mild to  life-threatening. In severe cases, the features of isovaleric acidemia become  apparent within a few days after birth. The initial symptoms include poor  feeding, vomiting, , and lack of energy (lethargy). These symptoms  sometimes progress to more serious medical problems, including , coma,  and possibly death. A characteristic sign of isovaleric acidemia is a  distinctive odor of sweaty feet during acute illness. This odor is caused by the  buildup of a compound called isovaleric acid in affected individuals. html:p In other cases, the signs and symptoms of isovaleric acidemia appear during  childhood and may come and go over time. Children with this condition may fail  to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and often have  . In these children, episodes of more serious health  problems can be triggered by prolonged periods without food (fasting),  infections, or eating an increased amount of protein-rich foods. html:p Some people with gene mutations that cause isovaleric acidemia are asymptomatic,  which means they never experience any signs or symptoms of the condition.

However, this estimate may be too low because Joubert syndrome has such a large range of possible features and is likely underdiagnosed. Particular genetic mutations that cause this condition are more common in certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jewish, French-Canadian, and Hutterite populations.
Description1: html:p Joubert syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. The signs  and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among  members of the same family. html:p The hallmark feature of Joubert syndrome is a combination of brain abnormalities  that together are known as the molar tooth sign, which can be seen on brain  imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This sign results from  the abnormal development of structures near the back of the brain, including  the cerebellar vermis and the brainstem. The molar tooth sign got its name  because the characteristic brain abnormalities resemble the cross-section of a  molar tooth when seen on an MRI. html:p Most infants with Joubert syndrome have  () in infancy,  which contributes to difficulty s  in early  childhood. Other characteristic features of the condition include episodes of  unusually fast (hyperpnea) or slow (apnea) breathing in infancy, and abnormal  eye movements (ocular motor apraxia). Most affected individuals have    Distinctive facial features can also occur in Joubert syndrome; these include a  broad forehead, arched eyebrows, droopy eyelids (ptosis), widely spaced eyes  (hypertelorism), low-set ears, and a triangle-shaped mouth. html:p Joubert syndrome can include a broad range of additional signs and symptoms. The  condition is sometimes associated with other eye abnormalities (such as retinal  dystrophy, which can cause vision loss, and coloboma, which is a gap or split  in a structure of the eye), kidney disease (including polycystic kidney disease  and nephronophthisis), liver disease, skeletal abnormalities (such as the  presence of extra fingers and toes), or hormone (endocrine) problems. A  combination of the characteristic features of Joubert syndrome and one or more  of these additional signs and symptoms once characterized several separate  disorders. Together, those disorders were referred to as Joubert syndrome and  related disorders (JSRD).

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/junctional-epidermolysis-bullosa
frequency1: Both types of junctional epidermolysis bullosa are rare, affecting fewer than 1 per million people in the United States.
Description1: html:p Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of  epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be  very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response  to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Researchers classify  junctional epidermolysis bullosa into two main types: Herlitz JEB and  non-Herlitz JEB. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap  significantly, and they can be caused by mutations in the same genes. html:p Herlitz JEB is the more severe form of the condition. From birth or early  infancy, affected individuals have blistering over large regions of the body.  Blistering also affects the mucous membranes, such as the moist lining of the  mouth and digestive tract, which can make it difficult to eat and digest food.  As a result, many affected children have chronic malnutrition and .  The extensive blistering leads to scarring and the formation of red, bumpy  patches called granulation tissue. Granulation tissue bleeds easily and  profusely, making affected infants susceptible to serious infections and loss of  necessary proteins, minerals, and fluids. Additionally, a buildup of  granulation tissue in the airway can lead to a weak, hoarse cry and difficulty  breathing. html:p Other complications of Herlitz JEB can include fusion of the fingers and toes,  abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails,  that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). Because the signs and symptoms  of Herlitz JEB are so severe, infants with this condition usually do not  survive beyond the first year of life. html:p The milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa is called non-Herlitz JEB.  The blistering associated with non-Herlitz JEB may be limited to the hands,  feet, knees, and elbows, and it often improves after the newborn period. Other  characteristic features of this condition include alopecia, malformed  fingernails and toenails, and irregular tooth enamel. Most affected individuals  do not have extensive scarring or granulation tissue formation, so breathing  difficulties and other severe complications are rare. Non-Herlitz JEB is  typically associated with a normal lifespan.

Description1: html:p Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a disorder that affects the skin, joints, and  bones. Individuals with this condition typically begin to develop signs and  symptoms within the first few years of life. Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is  characterized by skin bumps that frequently appear on the hands, neck, scalp,  ears, and nose. These skin bumps can also develop in joint creases and the  genital region. They vary in size and are sometimes painful. Affected  individuals usually develop more skin bumps over time. html:p Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is also characterized by overgrowth of the gums  (gingival hypertrophy) andthat can impair  movement. In addition, affected individuals may grow slowly and have bone  abnormalities. People with juvenile hyaline fibromatosis typically have severe  physical limitations, but most individuals have normal intelligence and live  into adulthood.

This condition begins in childhood or adolescence, usually between  ages 12 and 18, and lasts into adulthood. The most common type of seizure in  people with this condition is myoclonic , which cause rapid,  uncontrolled muscle jerks. People with this condition may also have generalized  tonic-clonic  (also known as grand mal ), which cause muscle  rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Sometimes, affected  individuals have absence , which cause loss of consciousness for a short  period that appears as a staring spell. Typically, people with juvenile  myoclonic  develop the characteristic myoclonic  in adolescence,  then develop generalized tonic-clonic  a few years later. Although  can happen at any time, they occur most commonly in the morning,  shortly after awakening.  can be triggered by a lack of sleep, extreme  tiredness, stress, or alcohol consumption.

Description1: html:p Juvenile Paget disease is a disorder that affects bone growth. This disease  causes bones to be abnormally large, misshapen, and easily broken (fractured). html:p The signs of juvenile Paget disease appear in infancy or early childhood. As  bones grow, they become progressively weaker and more deformed. These  abnormalities usually become more severe during the ,  when bones grow very quickly. html:p Juvenile Paget disease affects the entire skeleton, resulting in widespread bone  and joint pain. The bones of the skull tend to grow unusually large and thick,  which can lead to hearing loss. The disease also affects bones of the spine  (vertebrae). The deformed vertebrae can collapse, leading to abnormal curvature  of the spine. Additionally, weight-bearing long bones in the legs tend to bow  and fracture easily, which can interfere with standing and walking.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/juvenile-polyposis-syndrome
frequency1: Juvenile polyposis syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide.
Description1: html:p Juvenile polyposis syndrome is a disorder characterized by multiple noncancerous  (benign) growths called juvenile polyps. People with juvenile polyposis  syndrome typically develop polyps before age 20; however, in the name of this  condition"juvenile"refers to the characteristics of the tissues that make up  the polyp, not the age of the affected individual. These growths occur in the  gastrointestinal tract, typically in the large intestine (colon). The number of  polyps varies from only a few to hundreds, even among affected members of the  same family. Polyps may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, a shortage of red  blood cells (anemia), abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Approximately 15 percent of  people with juvenile polyposis syndrome have other abnormalities, such as a  twisting of the intestines (intestinal malrotation), heart or brain  abnormalities, an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), extra fingers  or toes (polydactyly), and abnormalities of the urinary tract. html:p Juvenile polyposis syndrome is diagnosed when a person has any one of the  following: (1) more than five juvenile polyps of the colon or rectum; (2)  juvenile polyps in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract; or (3) any number  of juvenile polyps and one or more affected family members. Single juvenile  polyps are relatively common in children and are not characteristic of juvenile  polyposis syndrome. html:p Three types of juvenile polyposis syndrome have been described, based on the  signs and symptoms of the disorder. Juvenile polyposis of infancy is  characterized by polyps that occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract during  infancy. Juvenile polyposis of infancy is the most severe form of the disorder  and is associated with the poorest outcome. Children with this type may develop  a condition called protein-losing enteropathy. This condition results in severe  diarrhea, failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to  thrive), and general wasting and weight loss (cachexia). Another type called  generalized juvenile polyposis is diagnosed when polyps develop throughout the  gastrointestinal tract. In the third type, known as juvenile polyposis coli,  affected individuals develop polyps only in their colon. People with generalized  juvenile polyposis and juvenile polyposis coli typically develop polyps during  childhood. html:p Most juvenile polyps are benign, but there is a chance that polyps can become  cancerous (malignant). It is estimated that people with juvenile polyposis  syndrome have a 10 to 50 percent risk of developing a cancer of the  gastrointestinal tract. The most common type of cancer seen in people with  juvenile polyposis syndrome is colorectal cancer.

frequency1: The prevalence of Kearns-Sayre syndrome is approximately 1 to 3 per 100,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body,  especially the eyes. The features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome usually appear before  age 20, and the condition is diagnosed by a few characteristic signs and  symptoms. People with Kearns-Sayre syndrome have progressive external  ophthalmoplegia, which is weakness or paralysis of the eye muscles that impairs  eye movement and causes drooping eyelids (ptosis). Affected individuals also  have an eye condition called pigmentary retinopathy, which results from  breakdown (degeneration) of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye (the  retina) that gives it a speckled and streaked appearance. The retinopathy may  cause loss of vision. In addition, people with Kearns-Sayre syndrome have at  least one of the following signs or symptoms: abnormalities of the electrical  signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects),  that cause , or  abnormally high levels of protein in the fluid that surrounds and protects the  brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF). html:p People with Kearns-Sayre syndrome may also experience muscle weakness in their  limbs, deafness, kidney problems, or a deterioration of cognitive functions  (dementia). Affected individuals often have . In addition, diabetes  mellitus is occasionally seen in people with Kearns-Sayre syndrome. html:p When the muscle cells of affected individuals are stained and viewed under a  microscope, these cells usually appear abnormal. The abnormal muscle cells  contain an excess of structures called mitochondria and are known as ragged-red  fibers. html:p A related condition called ophthalmoplegia-plus may be diagnosed if an  individual has many of the signs and symptoms of Kearns-Sayre syndrome but not  all the criteria are met.

Description1: html:p Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is characterized by eye problems,  skin abnormalities, and hearing loss. html:p People with KID syndrome usually have keratitis, which is inflammation of the  front surface of the eye (the cornea). The keratitis may cause pain, increased  sensitivity to light (photophobia), abnormal blood vessel growth over the cornea  (neovascularization), and scarring. Over time, affected individuals experience  a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity); in severe cases the keratitis  can lead to blindness. html:p Most people with KID syndrome have thick, hard skin on the palms of the hands  and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma). Affected individuals also have  thick, reddened patches of skin (erythrokeratoderma) that are dry and scaly  (ichthyosis). These dry patches can occur anywhere on the body, although they  most commonly affect the neck, groin, and armpits. Breaks in the skin often  occur and may lead to infections. In severe cases these infections can be  life-threatening, especially in infancy. Approximately 12 percent of people with  KID syndrome develop a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma,  which may also affect mucous membranes such as the lining of the mouth. html:p Partial hair loss is a common feature of KID syndrome, and often affects the  eyebrows and eyelashes. Affected individuals may also have small, abnormally  formed nails. html:p Hearing loss in this condition is usually profound, but occasionally is less  severe.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Keratoconus is an eye condition that affects the shape of the cornea, which is</span>  the clear outer covering of the eye. In this condition, the cornea thins and  bulges outward, eventually resembling a cone shape. These corneal abnormalities,  which worsen over time, can lead to nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision  that cannot be improved with corrective lenses (irregular astigmatism), and  vision loss. html:p Other corneal changes typical of keratoconus that can be seen during an eye exam  include iron deposits in the cornea that form a yellow-to-brownish ring, called  the Fleischer ring, surrounding the colored part of the eye (iris). Affected  individuals may also develop Vogt's striae, which are thin, vertical, white  lines in the tissue at the back of the cornea. html:p Keratoconus may affect only one eye at first, but eventually the corneas of both  eyes become misshapen, although they might not be affected with the same  severity. As keratoconus worsens, people with this condition can develop corneal  scarring, often caused by exposure of the abnormally thin cornea to prolonged  contact lens use or excessive eye rubbing. html:p The eye changes characteristic of keratoconus typically begin in adolescence and  slowly worsen until mid-adulthood at which point the shape of the cornea  remains stable.

Description1: html:p Keratoderma with woolly hair is a group of related conditions that affect the  skin and hair and in many cases increase the risk of potentially  life-threatening heart problems. People with these conditions have hair that is  unusually coarse, dry, fine, and tightly curled. In some cases, the hair is also  sparse. The woolly hair texture typically affects only scalp hair and is  present from birth. Starting early in life, affected individuals also develop  palmoplantar keratoderma, a condition that causes skin on the palms of the hands  and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused. html:p Cardiomyopathy, which is a disease of the heart muscle, is a life-threatening  health problem that can develop in people with keratoderma with woolly hair.  Unlike the other features of this condition, signs and symptoms of  cardiomyopathy may not appear until adolescence or later. Complications of  cardiomyopathy can include an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), heart failure,  and sudden death. html:p Keratoderma with woolly hair comprises several related conditions with  overlapping signs and symptoms. Researchers have recently proposed classifying  keratoderma with woolly hair into four types, based on the underlying genetic  cause. Type I, also known as Naxos disease, is characterized by palmoplantar  keratoderma, woolly hair, and a form of cardiomyopathy called arrhythmogenic  right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Type II, also known as Carvajal  syndrome, has hair and skin abnormalities similar to type I but features a  different form of cardiomyopathy, called dilated left ventricular  cardiomyopathy. Type III also has signs and symptoms similar to those of type I,  including ARVC, although the hair and skin abnormalities are often milder. Type  IV is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly and sparse hair, as  well as abnormal fingernails and toenails. Type IV does not appear to cause  cardiomyopathy.

Description1: html:p Kindler syndrome is a rare type of epidermolysis bullosa, which is a group of  genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. html:p From early infancy, people with Kindler syndrome have skin blistering,  particularly on the backs of the hands and the tops of the feet. The blisters  occur less frequently over time, although repeated blistering on the hands can  cause scarring that fuses the skin between the fingers and between the toes.  Affected individuals also develop thin, papery skin starting on the hands and  feet and later affecting other parts of the body. Other skin abnormalities that  occur with Kindler syndrome include patchy changes in skin coloring and small  clusters of blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectases), a combination  known as poikiloderma. In some affected individuals, the skin on the palms of  the hands and soles of the feet thickens and hardens (hyperkeratosis). Kindler  syndrome can also cause people to be highly sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) rays  from the sun and to sunburn easily. html:p Kindler syndrome can also affect the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, eyes,  esophagus, intestines, genitals, and urinary system, causing these tissues to be  very fragile and easily damaged. Affected individuals commonly develop severe  gum disease that can lead to early tooth loss. The moist tissues that line the  eyelids and the white part of the eyes (the conjunctiva) can become inflamed  (conjunctivitis), and damage to the clear outer covering of the eye (the cornea)  can affect vision. Narrowing (stenosis) of the esophagus, which is the tube  that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, causes difficulty with  swallowing that worsens over time. Some affected individuals develop health  problems related to inflammation of the colon (colitis) or damage to the mucosa  in the vagina, the anus, or the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of  the body (the urethra). html:p Kindler syndrome increases the risk of developing a form of cancer called  squamous cell carcinoma. This type of cancer arises from squamous cells, which  are found in the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and in the mucosae. In  people with Kindler syndrome, squamous cell carcinoma occurs most often on the  skin, lips, and the lining of the mouth (oral mucosa).

frequency1: Klippel-Feil syndrome is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 to 42,000 newborns worldwide. Females seem to be affected slightly more often than males.
Description1: html:p Klippel-Feil syndrome is a bone disorder characterized by the abnormal joining  (fusion) of two or more spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae). The  vertebral fusion is present from birth. Three major features result from this  vertebral fusion: a short neck, the resulting appearance of a low hairline at  the back of the head, and a limited range of motion in the neck. Most affected  people have one or two of these characteristic features. Less than half of all  individuals with Klippel-Feil syndrome have all three classic features of this  condition. html:p In people with Klippel-Feil syndrome, the fused vertebrae can limit the range of  movement of the neck and back as well as lead to chronic headaches and muscle  pain in the neck and back that range in severity. People with minimal bone  involvement often have fewer problems compared to individuals with several  vertebrae affected. The shortened neck can cause a slight difference in the size  and shape of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Trauma to  the spine, such as a fall or car accident, can aggravate problems in the fused  area. Fusion of the vertebrae can lead to nerve damage in the head, neck, or  back. Over time, individuals with Klippel-Feil syndrome can develop a narrowing  of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) in the neck, which can compress and damage  the spinal cord. Rarely, spinal nerve abnormalities may cause abnormal  sensations or involuntary movements in people with Klippel-Feil syndrome.  Affected individuals may develop a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis  around the areas of fused bone or experience painful  . In addition to the fused cervical bones,  people with this condition may have abnormalities in other vertebrae. Many  people with Klippel-Feil syndrome have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the  spine (scoliosis) due to malformation of the vertebrae; fusion of additional  vertebrae below the neck may also occur. html:p People with Klippel-Feil syndrome may have a wide variety of other features in  addition to their spine abnormalities. Some people with this condition have  hearing difficulties, eye abnormalities, an opening in the roof of the mouth  (cleft palate), genitourinary problems such as abnormal kidneys or reproductive  organs, heart abnormalities, or lung defects that can cause breathing problems.  Affected individuals may have other skeletal defects including arms or legs of  unequal length (limb length discrepancy), which can result in misalignment of  the hips or knees. Additionally, the shoulder blades may be underdeveloped so  that they sit abnormally high on the back, a condition called Sprengel  deformity. Rarely, structural brain abnormalities or a type of birth defect that  occurs during the development of the brain and spinal cord (neural tube defect)  can occur in people with Klippel-Feil syndrome. html:p In some cases, Klippel-Feil syndrome occurs as a feature of another disorder or  syndrome, such as Wildervanck syndrome or hemifacial microsomia. In these  instances, affected individuals have the signs and symptoms of both Klippel-Feil  syndrome and the additional disorder.

In people with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, the  port-wine stain usually covers part of one limb. The affected area may become  lighter or darker with age. Occasionally, port-wine stains develop small red  blisters that break open and bleed easily. html:p Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is also associated with overgrowth of bones and soft  tissues beginning in infancy. Usually this abnormal growth is limited to one  limb, most often one leg. However, overgrowth can also affect the arms or,  rarely, the torso. The abnormal growth can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness,  and reduced movement in the affected area. If the overgrowth causes one leg to  be longer than the other, it can also lead to problems with walking. html:p Malformations of veins are the third major feature of Klippel-Trenaunay  syndrome. These abnormalities include varicose veins, which are swollen and  twisted veins near the surface of the skin that often cause pain. Varicose veins  usually occur on the sides of the upper legs and calves. Veins deep in the  limbs can also be abnormal in people with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.  Malformations of deep veins increase the risk of a type of blood clot called a  deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If a DVT travels through the bloodstream and lodges  in the lungs, it can cause a life-threatening blood clot known as a pulmonary  embolism (PE). html:p Other complications of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome can include a type of skin  infection called cellulitis, swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema),  and internal bleeding from abnormal blood vessels. Less commonly, this  condition is also associated with fusion of certain fingers or toes (syndactyly)  or the presence of extra digits (polydactyly).

Description1: html:p Kniest dysplasia is a disorder of bone growth characterized by  (dwarfism) with other skeletal abnormalities and problems with vision and  hearing. html:p People with Kniest dysplasia are born with a short trunk and shortened arms and  legs. Adult height ranges from 42 inches to 58 inches. Affected individuals  have and  . These joint problems can also lead to arthritis. Other  skeletal features may include a rounded upper back that also curves to the side  (kyphoscoliosis), severely flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly),  dumbbell-shaped bones in the arms and legs, long and knobby fingers, and an  inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). html:p Individuals with Kniest dysplasia have a round, flat face with bulging and  wide-set eyes. Some affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of  the mouth called a cleft palate. Infants may also have breathing problems due  to weakness of the windpipe. Severe nearsightedness (myopia) and other eye  problems are common in Kniest dysplasia. Some eye problems, such as tearing of  the back lining of the eye (retinal detachment), can lead to blindness. Hearing  loss resulting from recurrent ear infections is also possible.

Description1: html:p Knobloch syndrome is a rare condition characterized by severe vision problems  and a skull defect. html:p A characteristic feature of Knobloch syndrome is extreme nearsightedness (high  myopia). In addition, several other eye abnormalities are common in people with  this condition. Most affected individuals have vitreoretinal degeneration, which  is breakdown (degeneration) of two structures in the eye called the vitreous  and the retina. The vitreous is the gelatin-like substance that fills the eye,  and the retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.  Vitreoretinal degeneration often leads to separation of the retina from the back  of the eye (retinal detachment). Affected individuals may also have  abnormalities in the central area of the retina, called the macula. The macula  is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such  as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. Due to abnormalities in the  vitreous, retina, and macula, people with Knobloch syndrome often develop  blindness in one or both eyes. html:p Another characteristic feature of Knobloch syndrome is a skull defect called an  occipital encephalocele, which is a sac-like protrusion of the brain  (encephalocele) through a defect in the bone at the base of the skull (occipital  bone). Some affected individuals have been diagnosed with a different skull  defect in the occipital region, and it is unclear whether the defect is always a  true encephalocele. In other conditions, encephaloceles may be associated with  disability; however, most people with Knobloch syndrome have normal  intelligence.

Krabbe disease is part of a group of disorders known as leukodystrophies, which  result from the loss of myelin (demyelination). This disorder is also  characterized by the abnormal presence of globoid cells, which are globe-shaped  cells that usually have more than one nucleus. html:p The symptoms of Krabbe disease usually begin before the age of 1 year (the  infantile form). Initial signs and symptoms typically include irritability,  muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, episodes of fever without any sign of  infection, stiff posture, and .

frequency1: LADD syndrome appears to be a rare condition; at least 60 cases have been described in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital (LADD) syndrome is a genetic disorder that mainly  affects the eyes, ears, mouth, and hands. LADD syndrome is characterized by  defects in the tear-producing lacrimal system (lacrimo-), ear problems  (auriculo-), dental abnormalities (dento-), and deformities of the fingers  (digital). html:p The lacrimal system consists of structures in the eye that produce and secrete  tears. Lacrimal system malformations that can occur with LADD syndrome include  an underdeveloped or absent opening to the tear duct at the edge of the eyelid  (lacrimal puncta) and blockage of the channel (nasolacrimal duct) that connects  the inside corner of the eye where tears gather (tear sac) to the nasal cavity.  These malformations of the lacrimal system can lead to chronic tearing  (epiphora), inflammation of the tear sac (dacryocystitis), inflammation of the  front surface of the eye (keratoconjunctivitis), or an inability to produce  tears. html:p Ears that are low-set and described as cup-shaped, often accompanied by hearing  loss, are a common feature of LADD syndrome. The hearing loss may be mild to  severe and can be caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness),  changes in the middle ear (conductive hearing loss), or both (mixed hearing  loss). html:p People with LADD syndrome may have underdeveloped or absent salivary glands,  which impairs saliva production. A decrease in saliva leads to dry mouth  (xerostomia) and a greater susceptibility to cavities. Individuals with LADD  syndrome often have small, underdeveloped teeth with thin enamel and peg-shaped  front teeth (incisors). html:p Hand deformities are also a frequent feature of LADD syndrome. Affected  individuals may have abnormally small or missing thumbs. Alternatively, the  thumb might be duplicated, fused with the index finger (syndactyly), abnormally  placed, or have three bones instead of the normal two and resemble a finger.  Abnormalities of the fingers include syndactyly of the second and third fingers,  extra or missing fingers, and curved pinky fingers (fifth finger clinodactyly).  Sometimes, the forearm is also affected. It can be shorter than normal with  that limits movement. html:p People with LADD syndrome may also experience other signs and symptoms. They can  have kidney problems that include hardening of the kidneys (nephrosclerosis)  and urine accumulation in the kidneys (hydronephrosis), which can impair kidney  function. Recurrent urinary tract infections and abnormalities of the  genitourinary system can also occur. Some people with LADD syndrome have an  opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a split in the  upper lip (cleft lip). The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely,  even among affected family members.

This form of lactose intolerance results in severe diarrhea. If affected infants  are not given a lactose-free infant formula, they may develop severe  dehydration and weight loss. html:p Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by reduced production of lactase  after infancy (lactase nonpersistence).

Myoclonus can occur when an affected person is at rest, and it is made worse by  motion, excitement, or flashing light (photic stimulation). In the later stages  of Lafora progressive myoclonus , myoclonus often occurs continuously  and affects the entire body. html:p Several types of  commonly occur in people with Lafora progressive  myoclonus . Generalized tonic-clonic  (also known as grand mal  ) affect the entire body, causing muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss  of consciousness. Affected individuals may also experience occipital ,  which can cause temporary blindness and visual hallucinations. Over time, the  worsen and become more difficult to treat. A life-threatening seizure  condition called status epilepticus may also develop. Status epilepticus is a  continuous state of seizure activity lasting longer than several minutes. html:p About the same time  begin,  function starts to decline.  changes, , confusion, and  difficulties ()  are among the early signs and symptoms of this disorder. As the condition  worsens, a continued loss of  function (dementia) impairs memory,  judgment, and thought. Affected people lose the ability to perform the  activities of daily living by their mid-twenties, and they ultimately require  comprehensive care. People with Lafora progressive myoclonus  generally  survive up to 10 years after symptoms first appear.

Description1: html:p Laing distal myopathy is a condition that affects skeletal muscles, which are  muscles that the body uses for movement. This disorder causes progressive  muscle weakness that appears in childhood. The first sign of Laing distal  myopathy is usually weakness in certain muscles in the feet and ankles. This  weakness leads to tightening of the Achilles tendon (the band that connects the  heel of the foot to the calf muscles), an inability to lift the first (big) toe,  and a high-stepping walk. Months to years later, muscle weakness develops in  the hands and wrists. Weakness in these muscles makes it difficult to lift the  fingers, particularly the third and fourth fingers. Many affected people also  experience s. html:p In addition to muscle weakness in the hands and feet, Laing distal myopathy  causes weakness in several muscles of the neck and face. A decade or more after  the onset of symptoms, mild weakness also spreads to muscles in the legs, hips,  and shoulders. Laing distal myopathy progresses very gradually, and most  affected people remain mobile throughout life. Life expectancy is normal in  people with this condition.

frequency1: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder. Its prevalence is estimated at 1 to 2 in 100,000 people.
Description1: html:p Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a disorder in which excess immune system cells  called Langerhans cells build up in the body. Langerhans cells, which help  regulate the immune system, are normally found throughout the body, especially  in the skin, lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, liver, and bone marrow. In Langerhans  cell histiocytosis, excess immature Langerhans cells usually form tumors called  granulomas. Many researchers now consider Langerhans cell histiocytosis to be a  form of cancer, but this classification remains controversial. html:p In approximately 80 percent of affected individuals, one or more granulomas  develop in the bones, causing pain and swelling. The granulomas, which usually  occur in the skull or the long bones of the arms or legs, may cause the bone to  fracture. html:p Granulomas also frequently occur in the skin, appearing as blisters, reddish  bumps, or rashes which can be mild to severe. The pituitary gland may also be  affected; this gland is located at the base of the brain and produces hormones  that control many important body functions. Without hormone supplementation,  affected individuals may experience delayed or absent puberty or an inability to  have children (infertility). In addition, pituitary gland damage may result in  the production of excessive amounts of urine (diabetes insipidus) and  dysfunction of another gland called the thyroid. Thyroid dysfunction can affect  the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism), body temperature, skin  and hair texture, and behavior. html:p In 15 to 20 percent of cases, Langerhans cell histiocytosis affects the lungs,  liver, or blood-forming (hematopoietic) system; damage to these organs and  tissues may be life-threatening. Lung involvement, which appears as swelling of  the small airways (bronchioles) and blood vessels of the lungs, results in  stiffening of the lung tissue, breathing problems, and increased risk of  infection. Hematopoietic involvement, which occurs when the Langerhans cells  crowd out blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, leads to a general reduction  in the number of blood cells (pancytopenia). Pancytopenia results in fatigue due  to low numbers of red blood cells (anemia), frequent infections due to low  numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), and clotting problems due to low  numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia). html:p Other signs and symptoms that may occur in Langerhans cell histiocytosis,  depending on which organs and tissues have Langerhans cell deposits, include  swollen lymph nodes, abdominal pain, yellowing of the skin and whites of the  eyes (jaundice), delayed puberty, protruding eyes, dizziness, irritability, and  . About 1 in 50 affected individuals experience deterioration of  neurological function (neurodegeneration). html:p Langerhans cell histiocytosis is often diagnosed in childhood, usually between  ages 2 and 3, but can appear at any age. Most individuals with adult-onset  Langerhans cell histiocytosis are current or past smokers; in about two-thirds  of adult-onset cases the disorder affects only the lungs. html:p The severity of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and its signs and symptoms, vary  widely among affected individuals. Certain presentations or forms of the  disorder were formerly considered to be separate diseases. Older names that were  sometimes used for forms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis include eosinophilic  granuloma, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease, and Letterer-Siwe disease. html:p In many people with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, the disorder eventually goes  away with appropriate treatment. It may even disappear on its own, especially if  the disease occurs only in the skin. However, some complications of the  condition, such as diabetes insipidus or other effects of tissue and organ  damage, may be permanent.

Description1: html:p Laryngo-onycho-cutaneous (LOC) syndrome is a disorder that leads to  abnormalities of the voicebox (laryngo-), finger- and toenails (onycho-), and  skin (cutaneous). Many of the condition's signs and symptoms are related to the  abnormal growth of granulation tissue in different parts of the body. This red,  bumpy tissue is normally produced during wound healing and is usually replaced  by skin cells as healing continues. However, in people with LOC syndrome, this  tissue grows even when there is no major injury. html:p One of the first symptoms in infants with LOC syndrome is a hoarse cry due to  ulcers or overgrowth of granulation tissue in the voicebox (the larynx). Excess  granulation tissue can also block the airways, leading to life-threatening  breathing problems; as a result many affected individuals do not survive past  childhood. html:p In LOC syndrome, granulation tissue also grows in the eyes, specifically the  conjunctiva, which are the moist tissues that line the eyelids and the white  part of the eyes. Affected individuals often have impairment or complete loss of  vision due to the tissue overgrowth. html:p Another common feature of LOC syndrome is missing patches of skin (cutaneous  erosions). The erosions heal slowly and may become infected. People with LOC  syndrome can also have malformed nails and small, abnormal teeth. The hard,  white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth (enamel) is  thin, which contributes to frequent cavities. html:p LOC syndrome is typically considered a subtype of another skin condition called  junctional epidermolysis bullosa, which is characterized by fragile skin that  blisters easily. While individuals with junctional epidermolysis bullosa can  have some of the features of LOC syndrome, they do not usually have overgrowth  of granulation tissue in the conjunctiva.

Description1: html:p Lattice corneal dystrophy type I is an eye disorder that affects the clear,  outer covering of the eye called the cornea. The cornea must remain clear for an  individual to see properly; however, in lattice corneal dystrophy type I,  protein clumps known as amyloid deposits cloud the cornea, which leads to vision  impairment. The cornea is made up of several layers of tissue, and in lattice  corneal dystrophy type I, the deposits form in the stromal layer. The amyloid  deposits form as delicate, branching fibers that create a lattice pattern. html:p Affected individuals often have recurrent corneal erosions, which are caused by  separation of particular layers of the cornea from one another. Corneal erosions  are very painful and can cause sensitivity to bright light (photophobia).  Lattice corneal dystrophy type I is usually bilateral, which means it affects  both eyes. The condition becomes apparent in childhood or adolescence and leads  to vision problems by early adulthood.

Name1: Lattice corneal dystrophy type II
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lattice-corneal-dystrophy-type-ii
frequency1: Lattice corneal dystrophy type II is a rare condition; however, the <span style="background:#FFFF00;">prevalence is unknown. While this condition can be found in populations</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">worldwide, it was first described in Finland and is more common there.</span>
Description1: html:p Lattice corneal dystrophy type II is characterized by an accumulation of protein  clumps called amyloid deposits in tissues throughout the body. The deposits  frequently occur in blood vessel walls and basement membranes, which are thin,  sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Amyloid  deposits lead to characteristic signs and symptoms involving the eyes, nerves,  and skin that worsen with age. html:p The earliest sign of this condition, which is usually identified in a person's  twenties, is accumulation of amyloid deposits in the cornea (lattice corneal  dystrophy). The cornea is the clear, outer covering of the eye. It is made up of  several layers of tissue, and in lattice corneal dystrophy type II, the amyloid  deposits form in the stromal layer. The amyloid deposits form as delicate,  branching fibers that create a lattice pattern. Because these protein deposits  cloud the cornea, they often lead to vision impairment. In addition, affected  individuals can have recurrent corneal erosions, which are caused by separation  of particular layers of the cornea from one another. Corneal erosions are very  painful and can cause sensitivity to bright light (photophobia). Amyloid  deposits and corneal erosions are usually bilateral, which means they affect  both eyes. html:p As lattice corneal dystrophy type II progresses, the nerves become involved,  typically starting in a person's forties. It is thought that the amyloid  deposits disrupt nerve function. Dysfunction of the nerves in the head and face  (cranial nerves) can cause paralysis of facial muscles (facial palsy); decreased  sensations in the face (facial hypoesthesia); and difficulty speaking, chewing,  and swallowing. Dysfunction of the nerves that connect the brain and spinal  cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain,  and heat (peripheral nerves) can cause loss of sensation and weakness in the  limbs (peripheral neuropathy). Peripheral neuropathy usually occurs in the lower  legs and arms, leading to muscle weakness, clumsiness, and difficulty sensing  vibrations. html:p The skin is also commonly affected in people with lattice corneal dystrophy type  II, typically beginning in a person's forties. People with this condition may  have thickened, sagging skin, especially on the scalp and forehead, and a  condition called cutis laxa, which is characterized by loose skin that lacks  elasticity. The skin can also be dry and itchy. Because of loose skin and muscle  paralysis in the face, individuals with lattice corneal dystrophy type II can  have a facial expression that appears sad.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Leber congenital amaurosis is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina,</span>  which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and  color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment  beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may  worsen very slowly over time. html:p Leber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems,  including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements  of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils,  which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering  the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more  slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all. Additionally, the  clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally  thin, a condition known as keratoconus. html:p A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic  of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and  rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Researchers suspect that this  behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children. html:p In rare cases,  reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. However,  researchers are uncertain whether these individuals actually have Leber  congenital amaurosis or another syndrome with similar signs and symptoms. html:p At least 13 types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types  are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related  eye abnormalities.

Name1: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/leber-hereditary-optic-neuropathy
frequency1: The prevalence of LHON in most populations is unknown. It affects 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 people in northeast England and Finland.
Description1: html:p Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is an inherited form of vision loss.  Although this condition usually begins in a person's teens or twenties, rare  cases may appear in early childhood or later in adulthood. For unknown reasons,  males are affected much more often than females. html:p Blurring and clouding of vision are usually the first symptoms of LHON. These  vision problems may begin in one eye or simultaneously in both eyes; if vision  loss starts in one eye, the other eye is usually affected within several weeks  or months. Over time, vision in both eyes worsens with a severe loss of  sharpness (visual acuity) and color vision. This condition mainly affects  central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and  recognizing faces. Vision loss results from the death of cells in the nerve  that relays visual information from the eyes to the brain (the optic nerve).  Although central vision gradually improves in a small percentage of cases, in  most cases the vision loss is profound and permanent. html:p Vision loss is typically the only symptom of LHON; however, some families with  additional signs and symptoms have been reported. In these individuals, the  condition is described as"LHON plus."In addition to vision loss, the features  of LHON plus can include movement disorders, s, and abnormalities of the  electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects). Some  affected individuals develop features similar to multiple sclerosis, which is a  chronic disorder characterized by muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness,  and a variety of other health problems.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/left-ventricular-noncompaction
frequency1: Left ventricular noncompaction is estimated to affect 8 to 12 per 1 million individuals per year. However, the condition is likely more common than this estimate because individuals who do not have any related signs or symptoms may not come to medical attention.
Description1: html:p Left ventricular noncompaction is a heart (cardiac) muscle disorder that occurs  when the lower left chamber of the heart (left ventricle), which helps the heart  pump blood, does not develop correctly. Instead of the muscle being smooth and  firm, the cardiac muscle in the left ventricle is thick and appears spongy. The  abnormal cardiac muscle is weak and has an impaired ability to pump blood  because it either cannot completely contract or it cannot completely relax. For  the heart to pump blood normally, cardiac muscle must contract and relax fully. html:p Some individuals with left ventricular noncompaction experience no symptoms at  all; others have heart problems that can include sudden cardiac death.  Additional signs and symptoms include abnormal blood clots, irregular heart  rhythm (arrhythmia), a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest  (palpitations), extreme fatigue during exercise (exercise intolerance),  shortness of breath (dyspnea), fainting (syncope), swelling of the legs  (lymphedema), and trouble laying down flat. Some affected individuals have  features of other s. Left ventricular noncompaction can be diagnosed  at any age, from birth to late adulthood. Approximately two-thirds of  individuals with left ventricular noncompaction develop heart failure.

Description1: html:p Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a bone disorder that affects the hips. Usually,  only one hip is involved, but in about 10 percent of cases, both hips are  affected. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease begins in childhood, typically between ages  4 and 8, and affects boys more frequently than girls. html:p In this condition, the upper end of the thigh bone, known as the femoral head,  breaks down. As a result, the femoral head is no longer round and does not move  easily in the hip socket, which leads to hip pain, limping, and restricted leg  movement. The bone eventually begins to heal itself through a normal process  called bone remodeling, by which old bone is removed and new bone is created to  replace it. This cycle of breakdown and healing can recur multiple times.  Affected individuals are often shorter than their peers due to the bone  abnormalities. Many people with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease go on to develop a  painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis in the hips at an early age.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that usually becomes apparent</span>  in the first year of life. This condition is characterized by progressive loss  of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression) and typically results  in death within two to three years, usually due to respiratory failure. A small  number of individuals do not develop symptoms until adulthood or have symptoms  that worsen more slowly. html:p The first signs of Leigh syndrome seen in infancy are usually vomiting,  diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), which disrupts eating. These  problems often result in an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected  rate (failure to thrive). Severe muscle and movement problems are common in  Leigh syndrome. Affected individuals may develop  (),  , and problems with  . Loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral  neuropathy), common in people with Leigh syndrome, may also make movement  difficult. html:p Several other features may occur in people with Leigh syndrome. Many individuals  with this condition develop weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the  eyes (ophthalmoparesis); rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); or  degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain  (optic atrophy). Severe breathing problems are common, and these problems can  worsen until they cause acute respiratory failure. Some affected individuals  develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle  that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. In addition, a substance  called lactate can build up in the body, and excessive amounts are often found  in the blood, urine, or the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and  spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) of people with Leigh syndrome. html:p The signs and symptoms of Leigh syndrome are caused in part by patches of  damaged tissue (lesions) that develop in the brains of people with this  condition. A medical procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals  characteristic lesions in certain regions of the brain. These regions include  the basal ganglia, which help control movement; the cerebellum, which controls  the ability to balance and coordinates movement; and the brainstem, which  connects the brain to the spinal cord and controls functions such as swallowing  and breathing. The brain lesions are often accompanied by loss of the myelin  coating around nerves (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves  to activate muscles used for movement or relay sensory information from the rest  of the body back to the brain.

Description1: html:p Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is a disorder that causes the immune system  to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are  conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body  effectively from foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Starting  from birth, people with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 develop serious  bacterial and fungal infections. html:p One of the first signs of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is a delay in the  detachment of the umbilical cord stump after birth. In newborns, the stump  normally falls off within the first two weeks of life; but, in infants with  leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, this separation usually occurs at three  weeks or later. In addition, affected infants often have inflammation of the  umbilical cord stump (omphalitis) due to a bacterial infection. html:p In leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, bacterial and fungal infections most  commonly occur on the skin and mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the  nose and mouth. In childhood, people with this condition develop severe  inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and other tissue around the teeth  (periodontitis), which often results in the loss of both primary and permanent  teeth. These infections often spread to cover a large area. A hallmark of  leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is the lack of pus formation at the sites  of infection. In people with this condition, wounds are slow to heal, which can  lead to additional infection. html:p Life expectancy in individuals with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is  often severely shortened. Due to repeat infections, affected individuals may not  survive past infancy.

Description1: elevation (commonly referred to as LBSL) is a progressive disorder that affects  the brain and spinal cord. Leukoencephalopathy refers to abnormalities in the  white matter of the brain, which is tissue containing nerve cell fibers (axons)  that transmit nerve impulses. html:p Most affected individuals begin to develop movement problems during childhood or  adolescence. However, in some individuals, these problems do not develop until  adulthood. People with LBSL have abnormal and  difficulty with s . In addition, affected  individuals lose the ability to sense the position of their limbs or vibrations  with their limbs. These movement and sensation problems affect the legs more  than the arms, making walking difficult. Most affected individuals eventually  require wheelchair assistance, sometimes as early as their teens, although the  age varies. html:p People with LBSL can have other signs and symptoms of the condition. Some  affected individuals develop recurrent  (),  difficulties  (),  problems, or mild deterioration of mental functioning.  Some people with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to severe  complications following minor head trauma, which may trigger a loss of  consciousness, other reversible neurological problems, or fever. html:p Distinct changes in the brains of people with LBSL can be seen using magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI). These characteristic abnormalities typically involve  particular parts of the white matter of the brain and specific regions (called  tracts) within the brainstem and spinal cord, especially the pyramidal tract and  the dorsal column. In addition, most affected individuals have a high level of  a substance called lactate in the white matter of the brain, which is identified  using another test called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

frequency1: LTBL is a rare condition. While its prevalence is unknown, at least 19 cases have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate  (LTBL) is a disorder that affects the brain. LTBL is one of a group of genetic  disorders called leukodystrophies, which feature abnormalities of the nervous  system's white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty  substance, called myelin, that insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid  transmission of nerve impulses. html:p LTBL is characterized by distinct changes in the brain, which can be seen using  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These abnormalities typically involve white  matter in regions of the brain known as the cerebrum and cerebellum.  Abnormalities can also be seen in other regions of the brain, including the  brainstem, which is the part that connects to the spinal cord. Affected brain  regions include the thalamus, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. Thinning of  the tissue that connects the left and right halves of the brain (the corpus  callosum) also occurs in people with LTBL. In addition, most affected  individuals have a high level of a substance called lactate in the brain and  elsewhere in the body. html:p The severity of the condition varies. Mildly affected individuals usually  develop signs and symptoms after the age of 6 months. Loss of mental and  movement abilities (psychomotor regression), , and  extreme irritability are common, and some people with mild LTBL develop  . However, after age 2, the signs and symptoms of the condition improve:  affected children regain some psychomotor abilities,  are reduced or  disappear, MRI results become more normal, and lactate levels drop. html:p Severely affected individuals have features that begin soon after birth. These  infants typically have    , , and . Some have extremely high levels of  lactate (lactic acidosis), which can cause serious breathing problems and an  abnormal heartbeat. Liver failure occurs in some severely affected infants. In  severe cases, the signs and symptoms do not improve and can be life-threatening.  In some people with LTBL, the features fall between mild and severe.

Milder forms may not become evident  until adolescence or adulthood, when  or  problems may be  the first signs of the disease. Some females with milder forms of  leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter who survive to adolescence  exhibit ovarian dysfunction. This variant of the disorder is called  ovarioleukodystrophy. html:p Progression of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is generally  uneven, with periods of relative stability interrupted by episodes of rapid  decline. People with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to stresses such  as infection, mild head trauma or other injury, or even extreme fright. These  stresses may trigger the first symptoms of the condition or worsen existing  symptoms, and can cause affected individuals to become lethargic or comatose.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare disorder that greatly increases the risk of</span>  developing several types of cancer, particularly in children and young adults. html:p The cancers most often associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome include breast  cancer, a form of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, and cancers of soft tissues  (such as muscle) called soft tissue sarcomas. Other cancers commonly seen in  this syndrome include brain tumors, cancers of blood-forming tissues  (leukemias), and a cancer called adrenocortical carcinoma that affects the outer  layer of the adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands on top of each  kidney). Several other types of cancer also occur more frequently in people  with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. html:p A very similar condition called Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome shares many of the  features of classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Both conditions significantly  increase the chances of developing multiple cancers beginning in childhood;  however, the pattern of specific cancers seen in affected family members is  different.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy
frequency1: It is difficult to determine the prevalence of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy because its features vary and overlap with those of other muscle disorders. Prevalence estimates range from 1 in 14,500 to 1 in 123,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a term for a group of diseases that cause  weakness and wasting of the muscles in the arms and legs. The muscles most  affected are those closest to the body (proximal muscles), specifically the  muscles of the shoulders, upper arms, pelvic area, and thighs. html:p The severity, age of onset, and features of limb-girdle muscle dystrophy vary  among the many subtypes of this condition and may be inconsistent even within  the same family. Signs and symptoms may first appear at any age and generally  worsen with time, although in some cases they remain mild. html:p In the early stages of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, affected individuals may  have an unusual walking gait, such as waddling or walking on the balls of their  feet, and may also have difficulty running. They may need to use their arms to  press themselves up from a squatting position because of their weak thigh  muscles. As the condition progresses, people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy  may eventually require wheelchair assistance. html:p Muscle wasting may cause changes in posture or in the appearance of the  shoulder, back, and arm. In particular, weak shoulder muscles tend to make the  shoulder blades (scapulae)"stick out"from the back, a sign known as scapular  winging. Affected individuals may also have an abnormally curved lower back  (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). Some develop    . Overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the calf muscles occurs in some  people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. html:p Weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) occurs in some forms of  limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Some affected individuals experience mild to  severe breathing problems related to the weakness of muscles needed for  breathing. In some cases, the breathing problems are severe enough that affected  individuals need to use a machine to help them breathe (mechanical  ventilation). html:p Intelligence is generally unaffected in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy; however,    forms of the disorder.

frequency1: Lipoid proteinosis is thought to be a rare condition; fewer than 500 cases have been described in the scientific literature. This condition occurs more frequently in certain areas of the world, including Turkey, Iran, and the Northern Cape province of South Africa.
Description1: html:p Lipoid proteinosis is a condition that results from the formation of numerous  small clumps (deposits) of proteins and other molecules in various tissues  throughout the body. These tiny clumps appear in the skin, upper respiratory  tract, the moist tissues that line body openings such as the eyelids and the  inside of the mouth (mucous membranes), and other areas. html:p The first symptom of this condition is usually a hoarse voice, which is due to  deposits in the vocal cords. In infancy the hoarseness is expressed as a weak  cry. The voice abnormalities persist throughout life and can ultimately cause  difficulty speaking or complete loss of . Involvement of the throat,  tonsils, and lips can result in breathing problems and upper respiratory tract  infections. Deposits in the tongue can result in a thick and shortened tongue.  They can also thicken the band of tissue that connects the tongue to the bottom  of the mouth (frenulum), making it difficult to extend the tongue. The tongue  may also have a smooth appearance due to damage to the taste buds. html:p A characteristic feature of lipoid proteinosis is the presence of multiple tiny,  bead-like bumps lining the upper and lower eyelids along the lash line. These  bumps are known as moniliform blepharosis. They may cause eyeball irritation or  itching but generally do not impair vision. html:p The skin and mucous membranes are often fragile in children with lipoid  proteinosis, leading to bleeding and scabbing following minor trauma. These  problems often first appear in infancy in the mouth and on the face and limbs.  Over time, these scabs form blisters and scars. Deposits accumulate in the skin,  which causes the skin to become thickened and yellowish in color. Skin damage  appears more frequently on areas that experience friction, such as the hands,  elbows, knees, buttocks, and armpits. Some people with this condition have hair  loss (alopecia) affecting their scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows. html:p Neurologic features are also common in people with lipoid proteinosis. Affected  individuals may have recurrent  () or  and  neurological problems, which can include headaches,  behaviors,  paranoia, hallucinations, short-term memory loss, and absence of fear. These  features are thought to be associated with the presence of deposits and an  accumulation of calcium (calcification) in areas of the brain called the  temporal lobes. The temporal lobes help process hearing, , memory, and  emotion. The brain abnormalities and neurological features do not always occur  together, so the cause of the neurological features is still unclear. html:p Deposits can be found in some internal organs, including the stomach, a section  of the small intestine called the duodenum, and the colon. The deposits in these  tissues often do not cause any symptoms and may disappear over time.

Description1: html:p Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a disorder that affects the connective tissue in many  parts of the body. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to  structures such as bones, ligaments, muscles, and blood vessels. html:p There are five types of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, labelled types I through V, which  are distinguished by their genetic cause. Regardless of the type, signs and  symptoms of Loeys-Dietz syndrome can become apparent anytime from childhood  through adulthood, and the severity is variable. html:p Loeys-Dietz syndrome is characterized by enlargement of the aorta, which is the  large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the  body. The aorta can weaken and stretch, causing a bulge in the blood vessel wall  (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may also lead to a sudden tearing of the  layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). People with Loeys-Dietz syndrome  can also have aneurysms or dissections in arteries throughout the body and have  arteries with abnormal twists and turns (arterial tortuosity). html:p Individuals with Loeys-Dietz syndrome often have skeletal problems including  premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis), an abnormal side-to-side  curvature of the spine (scoliosis), either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or  a protruding chest (pectus carinatum), an inward- and upward-turning foot  (clubfoot), flat feet (pes planus), or elongated limbs with joint deformities  Called . A membrane  called the dura, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, can be abnormally  enlarged (dural ectasia). In individuals with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, dural  ectasia typically does not cause health problems. Malformation or instability of  the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck is a common feature of Loeys-Dietz  syndrome and can lead to injuries to the spinal cord. Some affected individuals     html:p People with Loeys-Dietz syndrome may bruise easily and develop abnormal scars  after wound healing. The skin is frequently described as translucent, often with  stretch marks (striae) and visible underlying veins. Some individuals with  Loeys-Dietz syndrome develop an abnormal accumulation of air in the chest cavity  that can result in the collapse of a lung (spontaneous pneumothorax) or a  protrusion of organs through gaps in muscles (hernias). Other characteristic  features include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), eyes that do not point in  the same direction (strabismus), a split in the soft flap of tissue that hangs  from the back of the mouth (bifid uvula), and an opening in the roof of the  mouth (cleft palate). html:p Individuals with Loeys-Dietz syndrome frequently develop immune system-related  problems such as food allergies, asthma, or inflammatory disorders such as  eczema or inflammatory bowel disease.

The kidneys play  an essential role in maintaining the right amounts of minerals, salts, water,  and other substances in the body. In individuals with renal Fanconi syndrome,  the kidneys are unable to reabsorb important nutrients into the bloodstream.  Instead, the nutrients are excreted in the urine. These kidney problems lead to  increased urination, dehydration, and abnormally acidic blood (metabolic  acidosis). A loss of salts and nutrients may also impair and result in  soft, bowed bones (hypophosphatemic rickets), especially in the legs.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">In the United States, it is estimated that more than 221,000 people develop</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">lung cancer each year. An estimated 72 to 80 percent of lung cancer cases occur</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">in tobacco smokers.Approximately 6.6 percent of individuals will develop lung</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">cancer during their lifetime. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">accounting for an estimated 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">States.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and</span>  multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may or may not cause signs  or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain,  frequent coughing, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, blood in  the mucus, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or  neck. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies.  Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking;  however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked. html:p Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and  non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed  under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung  cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent. html:p Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and often spreads to other tissues  (metastasizes), most commonly to the adrenal glands (small hormone-producing  glands located on top of each kidney), liver, brain, and bones. In more than  half of cases, the small cell lung cancer has spread beyond the lung at the time  of diagnosis. After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive  for about one year; less than seven percent survive 5 years. html:p Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma,  squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises  from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the  lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from the squamous cells that line the  passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma  describes non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas  or squamous cell carcinomas. As the name suggests, the tumor cells are large  when viewed under a microscope. The 5-year survival rate for people with  non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower  or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a condition that affects the lungs, the</span>  kidneys, and the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system consists of a network of  vessels that transport lymph fluid and immune cells throughout the body. Lymph  fluid helps exchange immune cells, proteins, and other substances between the  blood and tissues. html:p LAM is found almost exclusively in women. It often occurs as a feature of an  inherited syndrome called tuberous sclerosis complex. When LAM occurs alone it  is called isolated or sporadic LAM. html:p Signs and symptoms of LAM most often appear during a woman's thirties. Affected  women have an overgrowth of abnormal smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) in the  lungs, resulting in the formation of lung cysts and the destruction of normal  lung tissue. They may also have an accumulation of fluid in the cavity around  the lungs (chylothorax). html:p The lung abnormalities resulting from LAM may cause difficulty breathing  (dyspnea), chest pain, and coughing, which may bring up blood (hemoptysis). Many  women with this disorder have recurrent episodes of collapsed lung (spontaneous  pneumothorax). The lung problems may be progressive and, without lung  transplantation, may eventually lead to limitations in activities of daily  living, the need for oxygen therapy, and respiratory failure. Although LAM cells  are not considered cancerous, they may spread between tissues (metastasize). As  a result, the condition may recur even after lung transplantation. html:p Women with LAM may develop cysts in the lymphatic vessels of the chest and  abdomen. These cysts are called lymphangioleiomyomas. Affected women may also  develop tumors called angiomyolipomas made up of LAM cells, fat cells, and blood  vessels. Angiomyolipomas usually develop in the kidneys. Internal bleeding is a  common complication of angiomyolipomas.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lymphedema-distichiasis-syndrome
frequency1: The prevalence of lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is unknown. Because the extra eyelashes can be overlooked during a medical examination, researchers believe that some people with this condition may be misdiagnosed as having lymphedema only.
Description1: html:p Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is a condition that affects the normal function  of the lymphatic system, which is a part of the circulatory and immune systems.  The lymphatic system produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout  the body. People with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome develop puffiness or  swelling (lymphedema) of the limbs, typically the legs and feet. Another  characteristic of this syndrome is the growth of extra eyelashes (distichiasis),  ranging from a few extra eyelashes to a full extra set on both the upper and  lower lids. These eyelashes do not grow along the edge of the eyelid, but out  of its inner lining. When the abnormal eyelashes touch the eyeball, they can  cause damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Related eye problems can  include an irregular curvature of the cornea causing blurred vision  (astigmatism) or scarring of the cornea. Other health problems associated with  this disorder include swollen and knotted (varicose) veins, droopy eyelids  (ptosis), heart abnormalities, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft  palate). html:p All people with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome have extra eyelashes present at  birth. The age of onset of lymphedema varies, but it most often begins during  puberty. Males usually develop lymphedema earlier than females, but all affected  individuals will develop lymphedema by the time they are in their forties.

frequency1: Lysinuric protein intolerance is estimated to occur in 1 in 60,000 newborns in Finland and 1 in 57,000 newborns in Japan. Outside these populations this condition occurs less frequently, but the exact incidence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Lysinuric protein intolerance is a disorder caused by the body's inability to  digest and use certain protein building blocks (amino acids), namely lysine,  arginine, and ornithine. Because the body cannot effectively break down these  amino acids, which are found in many protein-rich foods, nausea and vomiting are  typically experienced after ingesting protein. html:p People with lysinuric protein intolerance have features associated with protein  intolerance, including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly),  , muscle weakness, impaired immune function, and progressively brittle  bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis). A lung disorder called  pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may also develop. This disorder is characterized  by protein deposits in the lungs, which interfere with lung function and can be  life-threatening. An accumulation of amino acids in the kidneys can cause  end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in which the kidneys become unable to filter  fluids and waste products from the body effectively. A lack of certain amino  acids can cause elevated levels of ammonia in the blood. If ammonia levels are  too high for too long, they can cause coma and  disability. html:p The signs and symptoms of lysinuric protein intolerance typically appear after  infants are weaned and receive greater amounts of protein from solid foods.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lysosomal-acid-lipase-deficiency
frequency1: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 to 300,000 individuals, varying by population. The later-onset form is more common than the early-onset form.
Description1: html:p Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is an inherited condition characterized by  problems with the breakdown and use of fats and cholesterol in the body (lipid  metabolism). In affected individuals, harmful amounts of fats (lipids)  accumulate in cells and tissues throughout the body, which typically causes  liver disease. There are two forms of the condition. The most severe and rarest  form begins in infancy. The less severe form can begin from childhood to late  adulthood. html:p In the severe, early-onset form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, lipids  accumulate throughout the body, particularly in the liver, within the first  weeks of life. This accumulation of lipids leads to several health problems,  including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), poor weight gain, a  yellow tint to the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), vomiting,  diarrhea, fatty stool (steatorrhea), and poor absorption of nutrients from food  (malabsorption). In addition, affected infants often have calcium deposits in  small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands), low  amounts of iron in the blood (anemia), and . Scar tissue  quickly builds up in the liver, leading to liver disease (cirrhosis). Infants  with this form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency develop multi-organ failure  and severe malnutrition and generally do not survive past 1 year. html:p In the later-onset form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, signs and symptoms  vary and usually begin in mid-childhood, although they can appear anytime up to  late adulthood. Nearly all affected individuals develop an enlarged liver  (hepatomegaly); an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) may also occur. About  two-thirds of individuals have liver fibrosis, eventually leading to cirrhosis.  Approximately one-third of individuals with the later-onset form have  malabsorption, diarrhea, vomiting, and steatorrhea. Individuals with this form  of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency may have increased liver enzymes and high  cholesterol levels, which can be detected with blood tests. html:p Some people with this later-onset form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency  develop an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis).  Although these deposits are common in the general population, they usually  begin at an earlier age in people with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. The  deposits narrow the arteries, increasing the chance of heart attack or stroke.  The expected lifespan of individuals with later-onset lysosomal acid lipase  deficiency depends on the severity of the associated health problems. html:p The two forms of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency were once thought to be  separate disorders. The early-onset form was known as Wolman disease, and the  later-onset form was known as cholesteryl ester storage disease. Although these  two disorders have the same genetic cause and are now considered to be forms of  a single condition, these names are still sometimes used to distinguish between  the forms of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency.

Description1: html:p Mabry syndrome is a condition characterized by  disability,  distinctive facial features, increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline  phosphatase in the blood (hyperphosphatasia), and other signs and symptoms. html:p People with Mabry syndrome have      Many affected individuals have  () and develop recurrent  () in early childhood.  are usually the generalized  tonic-clonic type, which involve muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of  consciousness. html:p Individuals with Mabry syndrome have distinctive facial features that include  wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), long openings of the eyelids (long palpebral  fissures), a nose with a broad bridge and a rounded tip, downturned corners of  the mouth, and a thin upper lip. These facial features usually become less  pronounced over time. html:p Hyperphosphatasia begins within the first year of life in people with Mabry  syndrome. There are many different types of alkaline phosphatase found in  tissues; the type that is increased in Mabry syndrome is called the tissue  non-specific type and is found throughout the body. In affected individuals,  alkaline phosphatase levels in the blood are usually increased by one to two  times the normal amount, but can be up to 20 times higher than normal. The  elevated enzyme levels remain relatively stable over a person's lifetime.  Hyperphosphatasia appears to cause no negative health effects, but this finding  can help health professionals diagnose Mabry syndrome. html:p Another common feature of Mabry syndrome is shortened bones at the ends of  fingers (brachytelephalangy), which can be seen on x-ray imaging.  may also occur. Sometimes, individuals with Mabry  syndrome have abnormalities of the digestive system, including narrowing or  blockage of the anus (anal stenosis or anal atresia) or Hirschsprung disease, a  disorder that causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine. Rarely,  affected individuals experience hearing loss. html:p The signs and symptoms of Mabry syndrome vary among affected individuals. Those  who are least severely affected have only  disability and  hyperphosphatasia, without distinctive facial features or the other health  problems listed above.

Description1: html:p Macrozoospermia is a condition that affects only males. It is characterized by  abnormal sperm and leads to an inability to father biological children  (infertility). html:p In affected males, almost all sperm cells have abnormally large and misshapen  heads. The head of the sperm cell contains the male's genetic information that  is to be passed on to the next generation. Normally, the head of a sperm cell  contains one copy of each chromosome. In men with macrozoospermia, the sperm  cell head contains extra chromosomes, usually four copies of each instead of the  usual one. This additional genetic material accounts for the larger head size  of the sperm cell. Additionally, instead of having one tail (flagellum) per  sperm cell, affected sperm have multiple flagella, most often four. html:p Because of the additional genetic material, if one of these abnormal sperm cells  combines with an egg cell, the embryo will not develop or the pregnancy will  result in miscarriage.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/maffucci-syndrome
frequency1: Maffucci syndrome is very rare. Since it was first described in 1881, fewer than 200 cases have been reported worldwide.
Description1: html:p Maffucci syndrome is a disorder that primarily affects the bones and skin. It is  characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous (benign) growths  of cartilage that develop within the bones. These growths most commonly occur  in the limb bones, especially in the bones of the hands and feet; however, they  may also occur in the skull, ribs, and bones of the spine (vertebrae).  Enchondromas may result in severe bone deformities, shortening of the limbs, and  fractures. html:p The signs and symptoms of Maffucci syndrome may be detectable at birth, although  they generally do not become apparent until around the age of 5. Enchondromas  develop near the ends of bones, where occurs, and they frequently  stop forming after affected individuals stop growing in early adulthood. As a  result of the bone deformities associated with Maffucci syndrome, people with  this disorder generally have  and underdeveloped muscles. html:p Maffucci syndrome is distinguished from a similar disorder that involves  enchondromas (Ollier disease) by the presence of red or purplish growths in the  skin consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas). In addition  to hemangiomas, individuals with Maffucci syndrome occasionally also have  lymphangiomas, which are masses made up of the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid  (lymphatic vessels). These growths may appear anywhere on the body. html:p Although the enchondromas associated with Maffucci syndrome start out as benign,  they may become cancerous (malignant). In particular, affected individuals may  develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. People  with Maffucci syndrome also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as  ovarian or liver cancer. html:p People with Maffucci syndrome usually have a normal lifespan, and intelligence  is unaffected. The extent of their physical impairment depends on their  individual skeletal deformities, but in most cases they have no major  limitations in their activities.

frequency1: Mainzer-Saldino syndrome is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. At least 20 cases have been reported.
Description1: html:p Mainzer-Saldino syndrome is a disorder characterized by kidney disease, eye  problems, and skeletal abnormalities. html:p People with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome have chronic kidney disease that begins in  childhood and gets worse over time. The rate at which the kidney disease worsens  is variable, but the condition eventually leads to kidney failure in most  affected individuals. html:p Degeneration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina)  almost always occurs in this disorder, but the age at which this feature  develops varies. Some affected individuals are blind or have severe vision  impairment beginning in infancy, with the pattern of vision loss resembling a  condition called Leber congenital amaurosis. In other people with  Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, the retinal degeneration begins in childhood, but some  vision is retained into early adulthood. The vision loss in these affected  individuals resembles a category of retinal disorders called rod-cone  dystrophies. The most common rod-cone dystrophy is called retinitis pigmentosa,  and the vision problems in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome are sometimes referred to as  such. However, the abnormal deposits of pigment in the retina from which  retinitis pigmentosa gets its name are often not found in Mainzer-Saldino  syndrome. As a result, some researchers use terms such as"atypical retinitis  pigmentosa without pigment"to describe the retinal degeneration that occurs in  Mainzer-Saldino syndrome. html:p The skeletal abnormality most characteristic of Mainzer-Saldino syndrome  consists of cone-shaped ends of the bones (epiphyses) in the fingers (phalanges)  that can be seen on x-ray images after the first year of life. Affected  individuals may also have abnormalities of the thigh bones that occur in the  epiphyses and adjacent areas where bone growth occurs (the metaphyses).  Occasionally, other skeletal abnormalities occur, including  and  premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) that affects the  shape of the head and face. Affected individuals may also have a small rib cage,  which sometimes causes breathing problems in infancy, but the breathing  problems are usually mild. html:p A small number of individuals with this disorder have additional problems  affecting other organs. These can include liver disease resulting in a buildup  of scar tissue in the liver (hepatic fibrosis); cerebellar ataxia, which is  difficulty with coordination and balance arising from problems with a part of  the brain called the cerebellum; and mild  disability.

Description1: html:p Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to particular drugs that are often  used during surgery and other invasive procedures. Specifically, this reaction  occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the  sensation of pain, and with a muscle relaxant that is used to temporarily  paralyze a person during a surgical procedure. If given these drugs, people at  risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of  muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever, increased acid levels in the blood  and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate.

Description1: html:p Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) is a disorder that causes  abnormalities of the head and face. People with this disorder often have an  unusually small head at birth, and the head does not grow at the same rate as  the rest of the body, so it appears that the head is getting smaller as the body  grows (progressive microcephaly). Affected individuals have  that can range from mild to severe.  and  problems are also common in this disorder. html:p Facial abnormalities that occur in MFDM include  () and an unusually  small lower jaw (). The external  ears are small and abnormally shaped, and they may have skin growths in front of  them called preauricular tags. There may also be abnormalities of the ear  canal, the tiny bones in the ears (ossicles), or a part of the inner ear called  the semicircular canals. These ear abnormalities lead to hearing loss in most  affected individuals. Some people with MFDM have an opening in the roof of the  mouth (cleft palate), which may also contribute to hearing loss by increasing  the risk of ear infections. Affected individuals can also have a blockage of the  nasal passages (choanal atresia) that can cause respiratory problems. html:p Heart problems, abnormalities of the thumbs, and  are other  features that can occur in MFDM. Some people with this disorder also have  blockage of the esophagus (esophageal atresia). In esophageal atresia, the upper  esophagus does not connect to the lower esophagus and stomach. Most babies born  with esophageal atresia (EA) also have a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), in  which the esophagus and the trachea are abnormally connected, allowing fluids  from the esophagus to get into the airways and interfere with breathing.  Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is a life-threatening  condition; without treatment, it prevents normal feeding and can cause lung  damage from repeated exposure to esophageal fluids.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">The incidence of Marfan syndrome is approximately 1 in 5,000 worldwide.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Marfan syndrome is a disorder that affects the connective tissue in many parts</span>  of the body. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures  such as bones, ligaments, muscles, blood vessels, and heart valves. The signs  and symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary widely in severity, timing of onset, and  rate of progression. html:p The two primary features of Marfan syndrome are vision problems caused by a  dislocated lens (ectopia lentis) in one or both eyes and defects in the large  blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the  aorta). The aorta can weaken and stretch, which may lead to a bulge in the blood  vessel wall (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may cause the aortic valve  to leak, which can lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall  (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can be life threatening. html:p Many people with Marfan syndrome have additional heart problems including a leak  in the valve that connects two of the four chambers of the heart (mitral valve  prolapse) or the valve that regulates blood flow from the heart into the aorta  (aortic valve regurgitation). Leaks in these valves can cause shortness of  breath, fatigue, and an irregular heartbeat felt as skipped or extra beats  (palpitations). html:p Individuals with Marfan syndrome are usually tall and slender, have elongated  fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and have an arm span that exceeds their body  height. Other common features include a long and narrow face, crowded teeth, an  abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis), and either a sunken  chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Some  individuals develop an abnormal accumulation of air in the chest cavity that can  result in the collapse of a lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). A membrane called  the dura, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, can be abnormally enlarged  (dural ectasia) in people with Marfan syndrome. Dural ectasia can cause pain in  the back, abdomen, legs, or head. Most individuals with Marfan syndrome have  some degree of nearsightedness (myopia). Clouding of the lens (cataract) may  occur in mid-adulthood, and increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) occurs  more frequently in people with Marfan syndrome than in those without the  condition. html:p The features of Marfan syndrome can become apparent anytime between infancy and  adulthood. Depending on the onset and severity of signs and symptoms, Marfan can  be fatal early in life; however, the majority of affected individuals survive  into mid- to late adulthood.

frequency1: McCune-Albright syndrome occurs in between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 1,000,000 people worldwide.
Description1: html:p McCune-Albright syndrome is a disorder that affects the bones, skin, and several  hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues. html:p People with McCune-Albright syndrome develop areas of abnormal scar-like  (fibrous) tissue in their bones, a condition called polyostotic fibrous  dysplasia. Polyostotic means the abnormal areas (lesions) may occur in many  bones; often they are confined to one side of the body. Replacement of bone with  fibrous tissue may lead to fractures, uneven growth, and deformity. When  lesions occur in the bones of the skull and jaw it can result in uneven  (asymmetric) growth of the face. Asymmetry may also occur in the long bones;  uneven growth of leg bones may cause limping. Abnormal curvature of the spine  (scoliosis) may also occur. Bone lesions may become cancerous, but this happens  in fewer than 1 percent of people with McCune-Albright syndrome. html:p In addition to bone abnormalities, affected individuals usually have light brown  patches of skin called café-au-lait spots, which may be present from birth. The  irregular borders of the café-au-lait spots in McCune-Albright syndrome are  often compared to a map of the coast of Maine. By contrast, café-au-lait spots  in other disorders have smooth borders, which are compared to the coast of  California. Like the bone lesions, the café-au-lait spots in McCune-Albright  syndrome often appear on only one side of the body. html:p Girls with McCune-Albright syndrome usually reach puberty early. These girls  usually have menstrual bleeding by age two, many years before secondary sex  characteristics such as breast enlargement and pubic hair are evident. This  early onset of menstruation is believed to be caused by excess estrogen, a  female sex hormone, produced by cysts that develop in one of the ovaries. Less  commonly, boys with McCune-Albright syndrome may also experience early puberty. html:p Other endocrine problems may also occur in people with McCune-Albright syndrome.  The thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped organ at the base of the neck, may become  enlarged (a condition called a goiter) or develop masses called nodules. About  50 percent of affected individuals produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone  (hyperthyroidism), resulting in a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, weight  loss, s, sweating, and other symptoms. The pituitary gland (a structure at  the base of the brain that makes several hormones) may produce too much growth  hormone. Excess growth hormone can result in acromegaly, a condition  characterized by large hands and feet, arthritis, and distinctive facial  features that are often described as"coarse."Rarely, affected individuals  develop Cushing's syndrome, an excess of the hormone cortisol produced by the  adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney. Cushing's  syndrome causes weight gain in the face and upper body, slowed growth in  children, fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems.

Description1: html:p Meckel syndrome is a disorder with severe signs and symptoms that affect many  parts of the body. The most common features are enlarged kidneys with numerous  fluid-filled cysts; an occipital encephalocele, which is a sac-like protrusion  of the brain through an opening at the back of the skull; and the presence of  extra fingers and toes (polydactyly). Most affected individuals also have a  buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the liver. html:p Other signs and symptoms of Meckel syndrome vary widely among affected  individuals. Numerous abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord (central  nervous system) have been reported in people with Meckel syndrome, including a  group of birth defects known as neural tube defects. These defects occur when a  structure called the neural tube, a layer of cells that ultimately develops into  the brain and spinal cord, fails to close completely during the first few weeks  of embryonic development. Meckel syndrome can also cause problems with  development of the eyes and other facial features, heart, bones, urinary system,  And . html:p Because of their serious health problems, most individuals with Meckel syndrome  die before or shortly after birth. Most often, affected infants die of  respiratory problems or kidney failure.

frequency1: MCKD1 is a rare disorder, although its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 (MCKD1) is an inherited condition that  affects the kidneys. It leads to scarring (fibrosis) and impaired function of  the kidneys, usually beginning in adulthood. The kidneys filter fluid and waste  products from the body. They also reabsorb needed nutrients and release them  back into the blood. As MCKD1 progresses, the kidneys are less able to function,  resulting in kidney failure. html:p Declining kidney function in people with MCKD1 leads to the signs and symptoms  of the condition. The features are variable, even among members of the same  family. Many individuals with MCKD1 develop high blood pressure (hypertension),  especially as kidney function worsens. Some develop high levels of a waste  product called uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) because the damaged  kidneys are unable to remove uric acid effectively. In a small number of  affected individuals, the buildup of this waste product can cause gout, which is  a form of arthritis resulting from uric acid crystals in the joints. html:p Although the condition is named medullary cystic kidney disease, only about 40  percent of affected individuals have medullary cysts, which are fluid filled  pockets found in a particular region of the kidney. When present, the cysts are  usually found in the inner part of the kidney (the medullary region) or the  border between the inner and outer parts (corticomedullary region). These cysts  are visible by tests such as ultrasound or CT scan.

Since then, the condition has been reported in</span> individuals and families worldwide.
Description1: html:p Meesmann corneal dystrophy is an eye disease that affects the cornea, which is  the clear front covering of the eye. This condition is characterized by the  formation of tiny round cysts in the outermost layer of the cornea, called the  corneal epithelium. This part of the cornea acts as a barrier to help prevent  foreign materials, such as dust and bacteria, from entering the eye. html:p In people with Meesmann corneal dystrophy, cysts can appear as early as the  first year of life. They usually affect both eyes and increase in number over  time. The cysts usually do not cause any symptoms until late adolescence or  adulthood, when they start to break open (rupture) on the surface of the cornea  and cause irritation. The resulting symptoms typically include increased  sensitivity to light (photophobia), twitching of the eyelids (blepharospasm),  increased tear production, the sensation of having a foreign object in the eye,  and an inability to tolerate wearing contact lenses. Some affected individuals  also have temporary episodes of blurred vision.

frequency1: MMIHS is a rare disorder. More than 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a severe  disorder affecting the muscles that line the bladder and intestines. It is  characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through  the digestive tract (peristalsis) and empty the bladder. html:p Some of the major features of MMIHS can be recognized before birth using  ultrasound imaging. Affected fetuses have an enlarged bladder (megacystis)  because it does not empty. In addition, the large intestine (colon) is  abnormally narrow (microcolon) because of a shortage of functional muscle lining  it. Intestinal and bladder problems persist throughout life. html:p After birth, the continued impairment of peristalsis (hypoperistalsis) often  causes a digestive condition called intestinal pseudo-obstruction. This  condition, which mimics a physical blockage (obstruction) of the intestines but  without an actual blockage, leads to a buildup of partially digested food in the  intestines. This buildup can cause abdominal swelling (distention) and pain,  nausea, and vomiting. The vomit usually contains a green or yellow digestive  fluid called bile. Because digestion is impeded and the body does not get the  nutrients from food, nutritional support is usually needed, which is given  through intravenous feedings (parenteral nutrition). While some affected  individuals rely solely on intravenous feedings, others require it only on  occasion. Long-term use of parenteral nutrition can lead to liver problems. html:p The reduced ability to pass urine also contributes to painful distention of the  abdomen. Many people with MMIHS require placement of a tube (urinary catheter)  to remove urine from the bladder. html:p Another abnormality in some people with MMIHS is intestinal malrotation, in  which the intestines do not fold properly. Instead, they twist abnormally, often  causing a blockage. Individuals with MMIHS can also develop problems with the  kidneys or the ureters, which are the ducts that carry urine from the kidneys to  the bladder. html:p The life expectancy of people with MMIHS is shorter than normal, often due to  malnutrition, overwhelming infection (sepsis), or the failure of multiple  organs.

Description1: html:p Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts is a progressive  condition that affects brain development and function. Individuals with this  condition typically have an enlarged brain (megalencephaly) that is evident at  birth or within the first year of life. Megalencephaly leads to an increase in  the size of the head (macrocephaly). Affected people also have  leukoencephalopathy, an abnormality of the brain's white matter. White matter  consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin  insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. In  megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, the myelin is  swollen and contains numerous fluid-filled pockets (vacuoles). Over time, the  swelling decreases and the myelin begins to waste away (atrophy). Individuals  affected with this condition may develop cysts in the brain; because these cysts  form below an area of the brain called the cerebral cortex, they are called  subcortical cysts. These cysts can grow in size and number. html:p The brain abnormalities in people with megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with  subcortical cysts affect the use of muscles and lead to movement problems.  Affected individuals typically experience and  difficulty s . Walking ability varies greatly among  those affected. Some people lose the ability to walk early in life and need  wheelchair assistance, while others are able to walk unassisted well into  adulthood. Minor head trauma can further impair movements and may lead to coma.  Affected individuals may also develop  involuntary writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis), difficulty swallowing  (dysphagia), and impaired  (). More than half of all people with  this condition have recurrent  (). Despite the widespread brain  abnormalities, people with this condition typically have only mild to moderate  disability. html:p There are three types of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical  cysts, which are distinguished by their signs and symptoms and genetic cause.  Types 1 and 2A have different genetic causes but are nearly identical in signs  and symptoms. Types 2A and 2B have the same genetic cause but the signs and  symptoms of type 2B often begin to improve after one year. After improvement,  individuals with type 2B usually have macrocephaly and may have  disability.

frequency1: The prevalence of MCAP is unknown. At least 150 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. Because the condition is often thought to be misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, it may be more common than reported.
Description1: html:p Megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome (MCAP) is a disorder  characterized by overgrowth of several tissues in the body. Its primary features  are a large brain (megalencephaly) and abnormalities of small blood vessels in  the skin called capillaries (capillary malformations). html:p In individuals with MCAP, megalencephaly leads to an unusually large head size  (macrocephaly), which is typically evident at birth. After birth, the brain and  head continue to grow at a fast rate for the first few years of life; then, the  growth slows to a normal rate, although the head remains larger than average.  Additional brain abnormalities are common in people with MCAP; these can include  excess fluid within the brain (hydrocephalus) and abnormalities in the brain's  structure, such as those known as Chiari malformation and polymicrogyria.      particular, polymicrogyria is associated with  delays and difficulty  chewing and swallowing. html:p The capillary malformations characteristic of MCAP are composed of enlarged  capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These  malformations usually look like pink or red spots on the skin. In most affected  individuals, capillary malformations occur on the face, particularly the nose,  the upper lip, and the area between the nose and upper lip (the philtrum). In  other people with MCAP, the malformations appear as patches spread over the body  or as a reddish net-like pattern on the skin (cutis marmorata). html:p In some people with MCAP, excessive growth affects not only the brain but other  individual parts of the body, which is known as segmental overgrowth. This can  lead to one arm or leg that is bigger or longer than the other or a few  oversized fingers or toes. Some affected individuals have fusion of the skin  between two or more fingers or toes (cutaneous syndactyly). html:p Additional features of MCAP can include and skin that stretches  easily. Some affected individuals are said to have doughy skin because the  tissue under the skin is unusually thick and soft. html:p The gene involved in MCAP is also associated with several types of cancer. Only  a small number of individuals with MCAP have developed tumors (in particular, a  childhood form of kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor and noncancerous tumors in  the nervous system known as meningiomas).

People with MEGDEL syndrome also have high urine  levels of another acid called 3-methylglutaric acid. html:p In infancy, individuals with MEGDEL syndrome develop hearing loss caused by  changes in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness); the hearing problems  gradually worsen over time. html:p Another feature of MEGDEL syndrome is brain dysfunction (encephalopathy). In  infancy, encephalopathy leads to difficulty feeding, an inability to grow and  gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and  (). Infants with MEGDEL syndrome later develop  and , which worsen over time.  Because of these brain and muscle problems, affected babies have  or they may  . Individuals with MEGDEL syndrome have  disability and never learn to speak. html:p People with MEGDEL syndrome have changes in the brain that resemble those in  another condition called Leigh syndrome. These changes, which can be seen with  medical imaging, are referred to as Leigh-like disease. html:p Other features that occur commonly in MEGDEL syndrome include low blood sugar  (hypoglycemia) in affected newborns; liver problems (hepatopathy) in infancy,  which can be serious but improve by early childhood; and episodes of abnormally  high amounts of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis). html:p The life expectancy of individuals with MEGDEL syndrome is unknown. Because of  the severe health problems caused by the disorder, some affected individuals do  not survive past infancy.

Collectively, the many types of primary lymphedema affect an estimated 1 in 100,000 people younger than 20; Meige disease is the most common type of primary lymphedema.For unknown reasons, this condition affects females about three times as often as males.
Description1: html:p Meige disease is a condition that affects the normal function of the lymphatic  system. The lymphatic system consists of a network of vessels that transport  lymphatic fluid and immune cells throughout the body. Meige disease is  characterized by the abnormal transport of lymphatic fluid. When this fluid  builds up abnormally, it causes swelling (lymphedema) in the lower limbs. html:p Meige disease is classified as a primary lymphedema, which means it is a form of  lymphedema that is not caused by other health conditions. In Meige disease, the  lymphatic system abnormalities are present from birth (congenital), although  the swelling is not usually apparent until puberty. The swelling often begins in  the feet and ankles and progresses up the legs to the knees. Some affected  individuals develop non-contagious skin infections called cellulitis or  erysipelas in the legs, which can further damage the vessels that carry  lymphatic fluid.

Description1: html:p Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an inherited disorder characterized by the  accumulation of fats called sulfatides in cells. This accumulation especially  affects cells in the nervous system that produce myelin, the substance that  insulates and protects nerves. Nerve cells covered by myelin make up a tissue  called white matter. Sulfatide accumulation in myelin-producing cells causes  progressive destruction of white matter (leukodystrophy) throughout the nervous  system, including in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system) and  the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells  that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound (the peripheral  nervous system). html:p In people with metachromatic leukodystrophy, white matter damage causes  progressive deterioration of  functions and motor skills, such as  the ability to walk. Affected individuals also develop loss of sensation in the  extremities (peripheral neuropathy), incontinence, , paralysis, an  inability to speak, blindness, and hearing loss. Eventually they lose awareness  of their surroundings and become unresponsive. While neurological problems are  the primary feature of metachromatic leukodystrophy, effects of sulfatide  accumulation on other organs and tissues have been reported, most often  involving the gallbladder. html:p The most common form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, affecting about 50 to 60  percent of all individuals with this disorder, is called the late infantile  form. This form of the disorder usually appears in the second year of life.  Affected children lose any  they have developed, become weak, and develop  problems with walking (gait disturbance). As the disorder worsens, muscle tone  generally first decreases, and then increases to the point of rigidity.  Individuals with the late infantile form of metachromatic leukodystrophy  typically do not survive past childhood. html:p In 20 to 30 percent of individuals with metachromatic leukodystrophy, onset  occurs between the age of 4 and adolescence. In this juvenile form, the first  signs of the disorder may be  problems and increasing difficulty with  schoolwork. Progression of the disorder is slower than in the late infantile  form, and affected individuals may survive for about 20 years after diagnosis. html:p The adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy affects approximately 15 to 20  percent of individuals with the disorder. In this form, the first symptoms  appear during the teenage years or later. Often  problems such as  alcoholism, drug abuse, or difficulties at school or work are the first symptoms  to appear. The affected individual may experience  symptoms such as  delusions or hallucinations. People with the adult form of metachromatic  leukodystrophy may survive for 20 to 30 years after diagnosis. During this time  there may be some periods of relative stability and other periods of more rapid  decline. html:p Metachromatic leukodystrophy gets its name from the way cells with an  accumulation of sulfatides appear when viewed under a microscope. The sulfatides  form granules that are described as metachromatic, which means they pick up  color differently than surrounding cellular material when stained for  examination.

Description1: html:p Metatropic dysplasia is a skeletal disorder characterized by  (dwarfism) with other skeletal abnormalities. The term"metatropic"is derived  from the Greek word"metatropos,"which means"changing patterns."This name  reflects the fact that the skeletal abnormalities associated with the condition  change over time. html:p Affected infants are born with a narrow chest and unusually short arms and legs  with dumbbell-shaped long bones. Beginning in early childhood, people with this  condition develop abnormal side-to-side and front-to-back curvature of the spine  (scoliosis and kyphosis, often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur together).  The curvature worsens with time and tends to be resistant to treatment. Because  of the severe kyphoscoliosis, affected individuals may ultimately have a very  short torso in relation to the length of their arms and legs. html:p Some people with metatropic dysplasia are born with an elongated tailbone known  as a coccygeal tail; it is made of a tough but flexible tissue called cartilage.  The coccygeal tail usually shrinks over time. Other skeletal problems  associated with metatropic dysplasia include flattened bones of the spine  (platyspondyly); excessive movement of spinal bones in the neck that can damage  the spinal cord; either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest  (pectus carinatum); and that  .

In the most severe cases, the narrow chest and spinal  abnormalities prevent the lungs from expanding fully, which restricts breathing.  Researchers formerly recognized several distinct forms of metatropic dysplasia  based on the severity of the condition's features. The forms included a mild  type, a classic type, and a lethal type. However, all of these forms are now  considered to be part of a single condition with a spectrum of overlapping signs  and symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with  homocystinuria worsen over time, and the condition can be life-threatening if  not treated. html:p When methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria begins in adolescence or  adulthood, the signs and symptoms usually include  changes and  cognitive problems. Affected individuals can exhibit changes in their behavior  and personality; they may become less  and may experience hallucinations,  delirium, and psychosis. In addition, these individuals can begin to lose  previously acquired mental and movement abilities, resulting in a decline in  school or work performance, difficulty controlling movements, memory problems,  difficulties, a decline in  function (dementia), or an  extreme lack of energy (lethargy). Some people with methylmalonic acidemia with  homocystinuria whose signs and symptoms begin later in life develop a condition  called subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which leads to  numbness and weakness in the lower limbs, difficulty walking, and frequent  falls.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mevalonate-kinase-deficiency
frequency1: More than 200 people with mevalonate kinase deficiency have been reported worldwide; the majority of these individuals have HIDS.
Description1: html:p Mevalonate kinase deficiency is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes  of fever, which typically begin during infancy. Each episode of fever lasts  about 3 to 6 days, and the frequency of the episodes varies among affected  individuals. In childhood the fevers seem to be more frequent, occurring as  often as 25 times a year, but as the individual gets older the episodes occur  less often. html:p Mevalonate kinase deficiency has additional signs and symptoms, and the severity  depends on the type of the condition. There are two types of mevalonate kinase  deficiency: a less severe type called hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS)  and a more severe type called mevalonic aciduria (MVA). html:p During episodes of fever, people with HIDS typically have enlargement of the  lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), abdominal pain, joint pain, diarrhea, skin  rashes, and headache. Occasionally they will have painful sores called aphthous  ulcers around their mouth. In females, these may also occur around the vagina. A  small number of people with HIDS have  disability, problems with  , eye problems, and recurrent  ().  Rarely, people with HIDS develop a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in  the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure. Fever episodes in individuals with  HIDS can be triggered by vaccinations, surgery, injury, or stress. Most people  with HIDS have abnormally high levels of immune system proteins called  immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the blood. It is unclear  why people with HIDS have high levels of IgD and IgA. Elevated levels of these  immunoglobulins do not appear to cause any signs or symptoms. Individuals with  HIDS do not have any signs and symptoms of the condition between fever episodes  and typically have a normal life expectancy. html:p People with MVA have signs and symptoms of the condition at all times, not just  during episodes of fever. Affected children have  progressive ataxia, progressive problems with vision, and failure to gain weight  and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Individuals with MVA  typically have an unusually small, elongated head. In childhood or adolescence,  affected individuals may develop eye problems such as inflammation of the eye  (uveitis), a blue tint in the white part of the eye (blue sclera), an eye  disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss, or clouding of the  lens of the eye (cataracts). Affected adults may have  and may  develop muscle weakness (myopathy) later in life. During fever episodes, people  with MVA may have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly),  lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin rashes. Children with MVA  who are severely affected with multiple problems may live only into early  childhood; mildly affected individuals may have a normal life expectancy.

The final adult height of people with this condition ranges from 20 inches  to 40 inches. Other skeletal abnormalities in MOPDII include  , thinning of the bones in the arms  and legs, an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and  shortened wrist bones. In people with MOPDII head growth slows over time;  affected individuals have an adult brain size comparable to that of a  3-month-old infant. However,  development is typically normal. html:p People with this condition typically have a high-pitched, nasal voice that  results from a narrowing of the voicebox (subglottic stenosis). Facial features  characteristic of MOPDII include a prominent nose, full cheeks, a long midface,  and a small jaw. Other signs and symptoms seen in some people with MOPDII  include small teeth (microdontia) and farsightedness. Over time, affected  individuals may develop areas of abnormally light or dark skin coloring  (pigmentation). html:p Many individuals with MOPDII have blood vessel abnormalities. For example, some  affected individuals develop a bulge in one of the blood vessels at the center  of the brain (intracranial aneurysm). These aneurysms are dangerous because they  can burst, causing bleeding within the brain. Some affected individuals have  Moyamoya disease, in which arteries at the base of the brain are narrowed,  leading to restricted blood flow. These vascular abnormalities are often  treatable, though they increase the risk of stroke and reduce the life  expectancy of affected individuals.

These malformations look like pink or red  spots on the skin. People with microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome are  born with anywhere from a few to hundreds of these spots, which can occur  anywhere on the body. The spots are usually round or oval-shaped and range in  size from the head of a pin to a large coin. html:p Other signs and symptoms of microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome include  abnormal movements, feeding difficulties, , and .

frequency1: Microphthalmia occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Microphthalmia is an eye abnormality that arises before birth. In this  condition, one or both eyeballs are abnormally small. In some affected  individuals, the eyeball may appear to be completely missing; however, even in  these cases some remaining eye tissue is generally present. Such severe  microphthalmia should be distinguished from another condition called  anophthalmia, in which no eyeball forms at all. However, the terms anophthalmia  and severe microphthalmia are often used interchangeably. Microphthalmia may or  may not result in significant vision loss. html:p People with microphthalmia may also have a condition called coloboma. Colobomas  are missing pieces of tissue in structures that form the eye. They may appear as  notches or gaps in the colored part of the eye called the iris; the retina,  which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye;  the blood vessel layer under the retina called the choroid; or in the optic  nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain. Colobomas may be  present in one or both eyes and, depending on their size and location, can  affect a person's vision. html:p People with microphthalmia may also have other eye abnormalities, including  clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract) and a narrowed opening of the eye  (narrowed palpebral fissure). Additionally, affected individuals may have an  abnormality called microcornea, in which the clear front covering of the eye  (cornea) is small and abnormally curved. html:p Between one-third and one-half of affected individuals have microphthalmia as  part of a syndrome that affects other organs and tissues in the body. These  forms of the condition are described as syndromic. When microphthalmia occurs by  itself, it is described as nonsyndromic or isolated.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is a shortage (deficiency) of a protein</span>  complex called complex I or a loss of its function. Complex I is found in cell  structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form  that cells can use. Complex I is the first of five mitochondrial complexes that  carry out a multi-step process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which  cells derive much of their energy. html:p Mitochondrial complex I deficiency can cause a wide variety of signs and  symptoms affecting many organs and systems of the body, particularly the nervous  system, the heart, and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). These  signs and symptoms can appear at any time from birth to adulthood. html:p People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency typically have neurological  problems, such as abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), recurrent  (),  disability, difficulty s ,  Or . Affected individuals may have  (), muscle pain (myalgia), and extreme fatigue in response to  physical activity (exercise intolerance). They tend to develop elevated levels  of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting,  weakness, and rapid breathing. In severe cases, lactic acidosis can be  life-threatening. html:p People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency sometimes have heart, liver, or  kidney problems. Vision problems due to abnormal eye movement or breakdown  (degeneration) of the nerves that carry signals from the eyes to the brain  (optic nerves) can also occur. html:p Some people with mitochondrial complex I deficiency have groups of signs and  symptoms that are classified as a specific syndrome. For example, a condition  called Leigh syndrome is most commonly caused by mitochondrial complex I  deficiency. Leigh syndrome is characterized by  (and typically  results in death within 2 to 3 years from the onset of symptoms. Another  condition that can be caused by mitochondrial complex I deficiency, Leber  hereditary optic neuropathy, is associated mainly with vision problems due to  optic nerve degeneration. These syndromes can also have other causes.

Affected individuals may have feeding problems, , low  muscle tone (), extreme fatigue (lethargy), and  They tend to develop elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood (lactic  acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, weakness, and rapid breathing. High  levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) can also occur in affected  individuals, and in some cases result in abnormal brain function  (encephalopathy) and damage to other organs. html:p Another common feature of mitochondrial complex V deficiency is hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy. This condition is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of  the heart (cardiac) muscle that can lead to heart failure. People with  mitochondrial complex V deficiency may also have a characteristic pattern of  facial features, including a high forehead, curved eyebrows, outside corners of  the eyes that point downward (downslanting palpebral fissures), a prominent  bridge of the nose, low-set ears, thin lips, and a small chin (micrognathia). html:p Some people with mitochondrial complex V deficiency have groups of signs and  symptoms that are classified as a specific syndrome. For example, mitochondrial  complex V deficiency can cause a condition called neuropathy, ataxia, and  retinitis pigmentosa (NARP). NARP causes a variety of signs and symptoms chiefly  affecting the nervous system. Beginning in childhood or early adulthood, most  people with NARP experience numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs  (sensory neuropathy); muscle weakness; and  . Many affected individuals also have cognitive impairment  and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss. html:p A condition called Leigh syndrome can also be caused by mitochondrial complex V  deficiency. Leigh syndrome is characterized by  and typically  results in death within 2 to 3 years after the onset of symptoms. Both NARP and  Leigh syndrome can also have other causes.

Description1: html:p Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease is a  condition that affects several parts of the body, particularly the digestive  system and nervous system. The major features of MNGIE disease can appear  anytime from infancy to adulthood, but signs and symptoms most often begin by  age 20. The medical problems associated with this disorder worsen with time. html:p Abnormalities of the digestive system are among the most common and severe  features of MNGIE disease. Almost all affected people have a condition known as  gastrointestinal dysmotility, in which the muscles and nerves of the digestive  system do not move food through the digestive tract efficiently. The resulting  digestive problems include feelings of fullness (satiety) after eating only a  small amount, trouble swallowing (dysphagia), nausea and vomiting after eating,  episodes of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal blockage. These  gastrointestinal problems lead to extreme weight loss and reduced muscle mass  (cachexia). html:p MNGIE disease is also characterized by abnormalities of the nervous system,  although these tend to be milder than the gastrointestinal problems. Affected  individuals experience tingling, numbness, and weakness in their limbs  (peripheral neuropathy), particularly in the hands and feet. Additional  neurological signs and symptoms can include droopy eyelids (ptosis), weakness of  the muscles that control eye movement (ophthalmoplegia), and hearing loss.  Leukoencephalopathy, which is the deterioration of a type of brain tissue known  as white matter, is a hallmark of MNGIE disease. These changes in the brain can  be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), though they usually do not cause  symptoms in people with this disorder.

Calf weakness can make it difficult to stand on tiptoe. html:p As Miyoshi myopathy slowly worsens, the muscle weakness and atrophy spread up  the leg to the muscles in the thigh and buttock and can also involve the upper  arm and shoulder muscles. Eventually, affected individuals may have difficulty  climbing stairs or walking for an extended period of time. Some people with  Miyoshi myopathy may eventually need wheelchair assistance. html:p Rarely, s (arrhythmias) have developed in people with  Miyoshi myopathy. Individuals with Miyoshi myopathy have highly elevated levels  of an enzyme called creatine kinase (CK) in their blood, which often indicates  muscle disease.

Affected individuals must move their head from side to side to read or follow  the movement of objects. People with this disorder have difficulty making eye  contact, and their eyes may not look in the same direction (strabismus).  Additionally, the eyelids may not close completely when blinking or sleeping,  which can result in dry or irritated eyes. html:p Other features of Moebius syndrome can include bone abnormalities in the hands  and feet,  (), and hearing loss. Affected children  often experience  , although most eventually acquire these skills. html:p Some research studies have suggested that children with Moebius syndrome are  more likely than unaffected children to have characteristics of autism spectrum  disorders, which are a group of conditions characterized by impaired  and  interaction. However, recent studies have questioned  this association. Because people with Moebius syndrome have difficulty with eye  contact and  due to their physical differences, s  can be difficult to diagnose in these individuals. Moebius syndrome may also be  associated with a somewhat increased risk of  disability; however,  most affected individuals have normal intelligence.

Description1: html:p Monilethrix is a condition that affects hair growth. Its most characteristic  feature is that individual strands of hair have a beaded appearance like the  beads of a necklace. The name monilethrix comes from the Latin word for necklace  (monile) and the Greek word for hair (thrix). Noticeable when viewed under a  microscope, the beaded appearance is due to periodic narrowing of the hair  shaft. People with monilethrix also have sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis) and  short, brittle hair that breaks easily. html:p Affected individuals usually have normal hair at birth, but the hair  abnormalities develop within the first few months of life. In mild cases of  monilethrix, only hair on the back of the head (occiput) or nape of the neck is  affected. In more severe cases, hair over the whole scalp can be affected, as  well as pubic hair, underarm hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, or hair on the arms and  legs. html:p Occasionally, the skin and nails are involved in monilethrix. Some affected  individuals have a skin condition called keratosis pilaris, which causes small  bumps on the skin, especially on the scalp, neck, and arms. Affected individuals  may also have abnormal fingernails or toenails.

frequency1: MVA syndrome is a rare condition. Its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome is a rare disorder in which some  cells in the body have an abnormal number of chromosomes instead of the usual 46  chromosomes, a situation known as aneuploidy. Most commonly, cells have an  extra chromosome, which is called trisomy, or are missing a chromosome, which is  known as monosomy. In MVA syndrome, some cells are aneuploid and others have  the normal number of chromosomes, which is a phenomenon known as mosaicism.  Typically, at least one-quarter of cells in affected individuals have an  abnormal number of chromosomes. Because the additional or missing chromosomes  vary among the abnormal cells, the aneuploidy is described as variegated. html:p In MVA syndrome, .  After birth, affected individuals continue to grow at a slow rate and are  shorter than average. In addition, they typically have an unusually small head  size (microcephaly). Another common feature of MVA syndrome is an increased risk  of developing cancer in childhood. Cancers that occur most frequently in  affected individuals include a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma,  a form of kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor, and a cancer of the blood-forming  tissue known as leukemia. html:p Less commonly, people with MVA syndrome have eye abnormalities or distinctive  facial features, such as a broad nasal bridge and low-set ears. Some affected  individuals have brain abnormalities, the most common of which is called  Dandy-Walker malformation.  disability, , and other health  problems can also occur in people with MVA syndrome. html:p There are at least three types of MVA syndrome, each with a different genetic  cause. Type 1 is the most common and displays the classic signs and symptoms  described above. Type 2 appears to have slightly different signs and symptoms  than type 1, although the small number of affected individuals makes it  difficult to define its characteristic features. Individuals with MVA syndrome  type 2 grow slowly before and after birth; however, their head size is typically  normal. Some people with MVA syndrome type 2 have unusually short arms.  Individuals with MVA syndrome type 2 do not seem to have an increased risk of  cancer. Another form of MVA syndrome is characterized by a high risk of  developing Wilms tumor. Individuals with this form may also have other signs and  symptoms typical of MVA syndrome type 1.

Description1: html:p Moyamoya disease is a disorder of blood vessels in the brain, specifically the  internal carotid arteries and the arteries that branch from them. These vessels,  which provide oxygen-rich blood to the brain, narrow over time. Narrowing of  these vessels reduces blood flow in the brain. In an attempt to compensate, new  networks of small, fragile blood vessels form. These networks, visualized by a  particular test called an angiogram, resemble puffs of smoke, which is how the  condition got its name:"moyamoya"is an expression meaning"something hazy like  a puff of smoke"in Japanese. html:p Moyamoya disease commonly begins either around age 5 or in a person's thirties  or forties. A lack of blood supply to the brain leads to several symptoms of the  disorder, including temporary stroke-like episodes (transient ischemic  attacks), strokes, and . In addition, the fragile blood vessels that  grow can develop bulges (aneurysms), or they can break open, leading to bleeding  (hemorrhage) in the brain. Affected individuals may develop recurrent  headaches, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), or a decline in thinking  ability. The symptoms of moyamoya disease often worsen over time if the  condition is not treated. html:p Some people have the blood vessel changes characteristic of moyamoya disease in  addition to features of another disorder, such as neurofibromatosis type 1,  sickle cell disease, or Graves disease.

Description1: html:p Mucolipidosis type IV is an inherited disorder characterized by  and vision impairment that worsens over time. The severe form of the  disorder is called typical mucolipidosis type IV, and the mild form is called  atypical mucolipidosis type IV. html:p Approximately 95 percent of individuals with this condition have the severe  form. People with typical mucolipidosis type IV have  . Motor skills include sitting,  standing, walking, grasping objects, and writing. Psychomotor delay is moderate  to severe and usually becomes apparent during the first year of life. Affected  individuals have  disability, limited or absent , difficulty  chewing and swallowing,  () that gradually turns into  abnormal muscle , and problems controlling hand movements.  Most people with typical mucolipidosis type IV are unable to walk  independently. In about 15 percent of affected individuals, the psychomotor  problems worsen over time. html:p Vision may be normal at birth in people with typical mucolipidosis type IV, but  it becomes increasingly impaired during the first decade of life. Individuals  with this condition develop clouding of the clear covering of the eye (cornea)  and progressive breakdown of the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye  (retina). By their early teens, affected individuals have severe vision loss or  blindness. html:p People with typical mucolipidosis type IV also have impaired production of  stomach acid (achlorhydria). Achlorhydria does not cause any symptoms in these  individuals, but it does result in unusually high levels of gastrin in the  blood. Gastrin is a hormone that regulates the production of stomach acid.  Individuals with mucolipidosis type IV may not have enough iron in their blood,  which can lead to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). People with the severe  form of this disorder usually survive to adulthood; however, they may have a  shortened lifespan. html:p About 5 percent of affected individuals have atypical mucolipidosis type IV.  These individuals usually have mild psychomotor delay and may develop the  ability to walk. People with atypical mucolipidosis type IV tend to have milder  eye abnormalities than those with the severe form of the disorder. Achlorhydria  also may be present in mildly affected individuals.

Description1: html:p Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a condition that affects many parts of  the body. This disorder was once divided into three separate syndromes: Hurler  syndrome (MPS I-H), Hurler-Scheie syndrome (MPS I-H/S), and Scheie syndrome (MPS  I-S), listed from most to least severe. Because there is so much overlap  between each of these three syndromes, MPS I is currently divided into the  severe and attenuated types. html:p Children with MPS I often have no signs or symptoms of the condition at birth,  although some have a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical  hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). People with severe MPS I generally  begin to show other signs and symptoms of the disorder within the first year of  life, while those with the attenuated form have milder features that develop  later in childhood. html:p Individuals with MPS I may have a large head (macrocephaly), a buildup of fluid  in the brain (hydrocephalus), heart valve abnormalities, distinctive-looking  facial features that are described as"coarse,"an enlarged liver and spleen  (hepatosplenomegaly), and a large tongue (macroglossia). Vocal cords can also  enlarge, resulting in a deep, hoarse voice. The airway may become narrow in some  people with MPS I, causing frequent upper respiratory infections and short  pauses in breathing during sleep (sleep apnea). html:p People with MPS I often develop clouding of the clear covering of the eye  (cornea), which can cause significant vision loss. Affected individuals may also  have hearing loss and recurrent ear infections. html:p Some individuals with MPS I have  and  that affect mobility. Most people with the severe form of the  disorder also have dysostosis multiplex, which refers to multiple skeletal  abnormalities seen on x-ray. Carpal tunnel syndrome develops in many children  with this disorder and is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in  the hand and fingers. Narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) in the  neck can compress and damage the spinal cord. html:p While both forms of MPS I can affect many different organs and tissues, people  with severe MPS I experience a decline in  function and a more rapid  disease progression.  Is usually present by age 1, and    . Children with this form of the disorder usually have  a shortened lifespan, sometimes living only into late childhood. Individuals  with attenuated MPS I typically live into adulthood and may or may not have a  shortened lifespan. Some people with the attenuated type have  disabilities, while others have no  impairments. Heart disease and  airway obstruction are major causes of death in people with both types of MPS I.

It is a progressively debilitating disorder; however, the  rate of progression varies among affected individuals. html:p At birth, individuals with MPS II do not display any features of the condition.  Between ages 2 and 4, they develop full lips, large rounded cheeks, a broad  nose, and an enlarged tongue (macroglossia). The vocal cords also enlarge, which  results in a deep, hoarse voice. Narrowing of the airway causes frequent upper  respiratory infections and short pauses in breathing during sleep (sleep apnea).  As the disorder progresses, individuals need medical assistance to keep their  airway open. html:p Many other organs and tissues are affected in MPS II. Individuals with this  disorder often have a large head (macrocephaly), a buildup of fluid in the brain  (hydrocephalus), an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and a soft  out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen  (inguinal hernia). People with MPS II usually have thick skin that is not very  stretchy. Some affected individuals also have distinctive white skin growths  that look like pebbles. Most people with this disorder develop hearing loss and  have recurrent ear infections. Some individuals with MPS II develop problems  with the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye (retina) and have reduced  vision. Carpal tunnel syndrome commonly occurs in children with this disorder  and is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and  fingers. Narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) in the neck can  compress and damage the spinal cord. The heart is also significantly affected by  MPS II, and many individuals develop heart valve problems. Heart valve  abnormalities can cause the heart to become enlarged (ventricular hypertrophy)  and can eventually lead to heart failure. html:p Children with MPS II grow steadily until about age 5, and then their  . Individuals with this condition have  that significantly affect mobility. Most people with  MPS II also have dysostosis multiplex, which refers to multiple skeletal  abnormalities seen on x-ray. Dysostosis multiplex includes a generalized  thickening of most long bones, particularly the ribs. html:p There are two types of MPS II, called the severe and mild types. While both  types affect many different organs and tissues as described above, people with  severe MPS II also experience a decline in  function and a more  rapid disease progression. Individuals with the severe form begin to lose basic  between the ages of 6 and 8. The  life expectancy of these individuals is 10 to 20 years. Individuals with mild  MPS II also have a shortened lifespan, but they typically live into adulthood  and their intelligence is not affected. Heart disease and airway obstruction are  major causes of death in people with both types of MPS II.

frequency1: MONA is rare; its prevalence is unknown. This condition has been reported in multiple populations worldwide.
Description1: html:p Multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy (MONA) describes a rare  inherited disease characterized by a loss of bone tissue (osteolysis),  particularly in the hands and feet. MONA includes a condition formerly called  nodulosis-arthropathy-osteolysis (NAO) syndrome. It may also include a similar  disorder called Torg syndrome, although it is unknown whether Torg syndrome is  actually part of MONA or a separate disorder caused by a mutation in a different  gene. html:p In most cases of MONA, bone loss begins in the hands and feet, causing pain and  limiting movement. Bone abnormalities can later spread to other areas of the  body, with joint problems (arthropathy) occurring in the elbows, shoulders,  knees, hips, and spine. Most people with MONA develop low bone mineral density  (osteopenia) and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) throughout the skeleton.  These abnormalities make bones brittle and more prone to fracture. The bone  abnormalities also lead to . html:p Many affected individuals develop subcutaneous nodules, which are firm lumps of  noncancerous tissue underneath the skin, especially on the soles of the feet.  Some affected individuals also have skin abnormalities including patches of  dark, thick, and leathery skin. Other features of MONA can include clouding of  the clear front covering of the eye (corneal opacity), excess hair growth  (hypertrichosis), overgrowth of the gums, heart abnormalities, and distinctive  facial features that are described as"coarse."

frequency1: Multiminicore disease is thought to be a rare disorder, although its incidence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Multiminicore disease is a disorder that primarily affects muscles used for  movement (skeletal muscles). This condition causes muscle weakness and related  health problems that range from mild to life-threatening. html:p Researchers have identified at least four forms of multiminicore disease, which  can be distinguished by their characteristic signs and symptoms. The most  common form, called the classic form, causes muscle weakness beginning in  infancy or early childhood. This weakness is most noticeable in muscles of the  trunk and neck (axial muscles) and is less severe in the arm and leg muscles.  Muscle weakness causes affected infants to appear"floppy"(hypotonic) and can    The disease causes muscles of the ribcage and spine to stiffen. When combined  with weakness of the muscles needed for breathing, this stiffness leads to  severe or life-threatening respiratory problems. Almost all children with  multiminicore disease develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis),  which appears during childhood and steadily worsens over time. html:p Other forms of multiminicore disease have different patterns of signs and  symptoms. They are less common than the classic form, together accounting for  about 25 percent of all cases. The atypical forms of the condition tend to be  milder and cause few or no problems with breathing. The moderate form with hand  involvement causes  and , particularly in  . Another form of multiminicore disease, known as the  antenatal form with arthrogryposis, is characterized by  throughout the body (arthrogryposis), distinctive facial features, and other  birth defects. Paralysis of the eye muscles (external ophthalmoplegia) is a  primary feature of another atypical form of multiminicore disease. This form of  the condition also causes general muscle weakness and feeding difficulties that  appear in the first year of life. html:p Many people with multiminicore disease also have an increased risk of a  developing a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery and other  invasive procedures. This reaction is called malignant hyperthermia. Malignant  hyperthermia occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to  block the sensation of pain, and with a particular type of muscle relaxant. If  given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience  muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever,  increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid  heart rate. The complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening  unless they are treated promptly. html:p Multiminicore disease gets its name from small, disorganized areas called  minicores, which are found in muscle fibers of many affected individuals. These  abnormal regions can only be seen under a microscope. Although the presence of  minicores can help doctors diagnose multiminicore disease, it is unclear how  they are related to muscle weakness and the other features of this condition.

Description1: html:p Multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations (also known as VMCM) are  bluish patches (lesions) on the skin (cutaneous) and the mucous membranes, such  as the lining of the mouth and nose. These lesions represent areas where the  underlying veins and other blood vessels did not develop properly (venous  malformations). The lesions can be painful, especially when they extend from  the skin into the muscles and , or when a calcium deposit forms within the  lesion causing inflammation and swelling. html:p Most people with VMCM are born with at least one venous malformation. As  affected individuals age, the lesions present from birth usually become larger  and new lesions often appear. The size, number, and location of venous  malformations vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same  family.

frequency1: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 affects about 1 in 30,000 people; multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 affects an estimated 1 in 35,000 people. Among the subtypes of type 2, type 2A is the most common form, followed by FMTC. Type 2B is relatively uncommon, accounting for about 5 percent of all cases of type 2. The prevalence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 is unknown, although the condition appears to be rare.
Description1: html:p Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a group of disorders that affect the body's  network of hormone-producing glands called the endocrine system. Hormones are  chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream and regulate the  function of cells and tissues throughout the body. Multiple endocrine neoplasia  typically involves tumors (neoplasia) in at least two endocrine glands; tumors  can also develop in other organs and tissues. These growths can be noncancerous  (benign) or cancerous (malignant). If the tumors become cancerous, the condition  can be life-threatening. html:p The major forms of multiple endocrine neoplasia are called type 1, type 2, and  type 4. These types are distinguished by the genes involved, the types of  hormones made, and the characteristic signs and symptoms. html:p Many different types of tumors are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia.  Type 1 frequently involves tumors of the parathyroid glands, the pituitary  gland, and the pancreas. Tumors in these glands can lead to the overproduction  of hormones. The most common sign of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is  overactivity of the parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism).  Hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of calcium in the blood, which  can lead to kidney stones, thinning of bones, nausea and vomiting, high blood  pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. html:p The most common sign of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is a form of thyroid  cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma. Some people with this disorder also  develop a pheochromocytoma, which is an adrenal gland tumor that can cause  dangerously high blood pressure. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is divided  into three subtypes: type 2A, type 2B (formerly called type 3), and familial  medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). These subtypes differ in their  characteristic signs and symptoms and risk of specific tumors; for example,  hyperparathyroidism occurs only in type 2A, and medullary thyroid carcinoma is  the only feature of FMTC. The signs and symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia  type 2 are relatively consistent within any one family. html:p Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 appears to have signs and symptoms similar  to those of type 1, although it is caused by mutations in a different gene.  Hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature, followed by tumors of the  pituitary gland, additional endocrine glands, and other organs.

Description1: html:p Multiple familial trichoepithelioma is a condition involving multiple skin  tumors that develop from structures associated with the skin (skin appendages),  such as hair follicles and sweat glands. People with multiple familial  trichoepithelioma typically develop large numbers of smooth, round tumors called  trichoepitheliomas, which arise from hair follicles. Trichoepitheliomas are  generally noncancerous (benign) but occasionally develop into a type of skin  cancer called basal cell carcinoma. html:p Individuals with multiple familial trichoepithelioma occasionally also develop  other types of tumors, including growths called spiradenomas and cylindromas.  Spiradenomas develop in sweat glands. The origin of cylindromas has been  unclear; while previously thought to derive from sweat glands, they are now  generally believed to begin in hair follicles. Affected individuals are also at  increased risk of developing tumors in tissues other than skin appendages,  particularly benign or malignant tumors of the salivary glands. html:p People with multiple familial trichoepithelioma typically begin developing  tumors during childhood or adolescence. The tumors mostly appear on the face,  especially in the folds in the skin between the nose and lips (nasolabial folds,  sometimes called smile lines), but may also occur on the neck, scalp, or trunk.  They may grow larger and increase in number over time. html:p In severe cases, the tumors may get in the way of the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth  and affect vision, hearing, or other functions. The growths can be disfiguring  and may contribute to  or other psychological problems. For reasons  that are unclear, females with multiple familial trichoepithelioma are often  more severely affected than males.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Multiple myeloma is a cancer that develops in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue</span>  found in the center of most bones. The bone marrow produces red blood cells,  which carry oxygen throughout the body; white blood cells, which form the body's  defenses (immune system); and platelets, which are necessary for blood  clotting. html:p Multiple myeloma is characterized by abnormalities in plasma cells, a type of  white blood cell. These abnormal cells multiply out of control, increasing from  about one percent of cells in the bone marrow to the majority of bone marrow  cells. The abnormal cells form tumors within the bone, causing bone pain and an  increased risk of fractures. If the tumors interfere with nerves near the bones,  numbness or weakness in the arms or legs can occur. Affected individuals may  also experience a loss of bone tissue, particularly in the skull, spine, ribs,  and pelvis. The deterioration of bone can result in an excess of calcium in the  blood (hypercalcemia), which can lead to nausea and loss of appetite, excessive  thirst, fatigue, muscle weakness, and confusion. html:p The abnormal plasma cells in multiple myeloma produce proteins that impair the  . As a result, affected individuals may have a  reduced number of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause fatigue, weakness,  and unusually pale skin (pallor); a low number of white blood cells  (leukopenia), which can result in a weakened immune system and frequent  infections such as pneumonia; and a reduced number of platelets  (thrombocytopenia), which can lead to abnormal bleeding and bruising. Kidney  problems can also occur in this disorder, caused by hypercalcemia or by toxic  proteins produced by the abnormal plasma cells. html:p People with multiple myeloma typically develop the disorder around age 65. Over  time, affected individuals can develop life-threatening complications, but the  rate at which this happens varies widely. Some affected individuals are  diagnosed incidentally when tests are done for other purposes and do not  experience symptoms for years.

In addition, affected fetuses may develop a buildup of excess  fluid in the body (hydrops fetalis) or a fluid-filled sac typically found on the  back of the neck (cystic hygroma). Individuals with this type have severe  arthrogryposis. Lethal multiple pterygium syndrome is associated with  abnormalities such as  ; twisting of the intestines (intestinal malrotation); kidney  abnormalities; an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate); and an  unusually small head size (microcephaly). Affected individuals may also develop  a hole in the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the  diaphragm), a condition called a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Lethal  multiple pterygium syndrome is typically fatal in the second or third trimester  of pregnancy.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">An estimated 1.1 to 2.5 million people worldwide have multiple sclerosis.</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Although the reason is unclear, this condition is more common in regions that</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">are farther away from the equator. In Canada, parts of the northern United</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">States, western and northern Europe, Russia, and southeastern Australia, the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">condition affects approximately 1 in 2,000 to 2,400 people. It is less common</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">closer to the equator, such as in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of South</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">America, where about 1 in 20,000 people are affected. For unknown reasons, most</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">forms of multiple sclerosis affect women twice as often as men; however, women</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">and men are equally affected by primary progressive MS.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Multiple sclerosis is a condition characterized by areas of damage (lesions) on</span>  the brain and spinal cord. These lesions are associated with destruction of the  covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve  impulses (the myelin sheath) and damage to nerve cells. Multiple sclerosis is  considered an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune  system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs, in this case  tissues of the nervous system. html:p Multiple sclerosis usually begins in early adulthood, between ages 20 and 40.  The symptoms vary widely, and affected individuals can experience one or more  effects of nervous system damage. Multiple sclerosis often causes sensory  disturbances in the limbs, including a prickling or tingling sensation  (paresthesia), numbness, pain, and itching. Some people experience Lhermitte  sign, which is an electrical shock-like sensation that runs down the back and  into the limbs. This sensation usually occurs when the head is bent forward.  Problems with muscle control are common in people with multiple sclerosis.  Affected individuals may have s,  exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), weakness or partial paralysis of the  muscles of the limbs, difficulty walking, or poor bladder control. Multiple  sclerosis is also associated with vision problems, such as blurred or double  vision or partial or complete vision loss. Infections that cause fever can make  the symptoms worse. html:p There are several forms of multiple sclerosis: relapsing-remitting MS, secondary  progressive MS, primary progressive MS, and progressive relapsing MS. The most  common is the relapsing-remitting form, which affects approximately 80 percent  of people with multiple sclerosis. Individuals with this form of the condition  have periods during which they experience symptoms, called clinical attacks,  followed by periods without any symptoms (remission). The triggers of clinical  attacks and remissions are unknown. After about 10 years, relapsing-remitting MS  usually develops into another form of the disorder called secondary progressive  MS. In this form, there are no remissions, and symptoms of the condition  continually worsen. html:p Primary progressive MS is the next most common form, affecting approximately 10  to 20 percent of people with multiple sclerosis. This form is characterized by  constant symptoms that worsen over time, with no clinical attacks or remissions.  Primary progressive MS typically begins later than the other forms, around age  40 html:p Progressive relapsing MS is a rare form of multiple sclerosis that initially  appears like primary progressive MS, with constant symptoms. However, people  with progressive relapsing MS also experience clinical attacks of more severe  symptoms.

Name1: Multiple sulfatase deficiency
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/multiple-sulfatase-deficiency
frequency1: Multiple sulfatase deficiency is estimated to occur in 1 per million individuals worldwide. Approximately 50 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Multiple sulfatase deficiency is a condition that mainly affects the brain,  skin, and skeleton. Because the signs and symptoms of multiple sulfatase  deficiency vary widely, researchers have split the condition into three types:  neonatal, late-infantile, and juvenile. html:p The neonatal type is the most severe form, with signs and symptoms appearing  soon after birth. Affected individuals have deterioration of tissue in the  nervous system (leukodystrophy), which can contribute to movement problems,  , and . They also have dry, scaly skin  (ichthyosis) and excess hair growth (hypertrichosis). Skeletal abnormalities can  include abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), joint  stiffness, and dysostosis multiplex, which refers to a specific pattern of  skeletal abnormalities seen on x-ray. Individuals with the neonatal type  typically have facial features that can be described as"coarse."Affected  individuals may also have hearing loss, heart malformations, and an enlarged  liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Many of the signs and symptoms of  neonatal multiple sulfatase deficiency worsen over time. html:p The late-infantile type is the most common form of multiple sulfatase  deficiency. It is characterized by normal cognitive development in early  childhood followed by a progressive loss of mental abilities and movement  (psychomotor regression) due to leukodystrophy or other brain abnormalities.  Individuals with this form of the condition do not have as many features as  those with the neonatal type, but they often have ichthyosis, skeletal  abnormalities, and coarse facial features. html:p The juvenile type is the rarest form of multiple sulfatase deficiency. Signs and  symptoms of the juvenile type appear in mid- to late childhood. Affected  individuals have normal early cognitive development but then experience  ; however, the regression in the juvenile type usually  occurs at a slower rate than in the late-infantile type. Ichthyosis is also  common in the juvenile type of multiple sulfatase deficiency. html:p Life expectancy is shortened in individuals with all types of multiple sulfatase  deficiency. Typically, affected individuals survive only a few years after the  signs and symptoms of the condition appear, but life expectancy varies depending  on the severity of the condition and how quickly the neurological problems  worsen.

frequency1: Multiple system atrophy has a prevalence of 2 to 5 per 100,000 people.
Description1: html:p Multiple system atrophy is a progressive brain disorder that affects movement  and balance and disrupts the function of the autonomic nervous system. The  autonomic nervous system controls body functions that are mostly involuntary,  such as regulation of blood pressure. The most frequent autonomic symptoms  associated with multiple system atrophy are a sudden drop in blood pressure upon  standing (orthostatic hypotension), urinary difficulties, and erectile  dysfunction in men. html:p Researchers have described two major types of multiple system atrophy, which are  distinguished by their major signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis. In  one type, known as MSA-P, a group of movement abnormalities called parkinsonism  are predominant. These abnormalities include unusually slow movement  (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, s, and an inability to hold the body  upright and balanced (postural instability). The other type of multiple system  atrophy, known as MSA-C, is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, which causes  problems with coordination and balance. This form of the condition can also  include  difficulties () and problems controlling eye movement. html:p Multiple system atrophy usually occurs in older adults; on average, signs and  symptoms appear around age 55. The condition worsens with time, and affected  individuals survive an average of 10 years after the signs and symptoms first  appear.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Myasthenia gravis affects about 20 per 100,000 people worldwide. The</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">prevalence has been increasing in recent decades, which likely results from</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">earlier diagnosis and better treatments leading to longer lifespans for affected</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">individuals.</span>
Description1: html:p Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles,  which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often  starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis)  and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double  vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains  confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however,  additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may  have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head,  impairment (), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that  may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling. html:p Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia  gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected  individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects,  rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to  fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest. html:p Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the  abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in  some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this  disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these  respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired,  and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory  failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as  infections or reactions to medications. html:p People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown,  it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than  age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with  myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days  or weeks of life. This temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient  neonatal myasthenia gravis.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mycosis-fungoides
frequency1: Mycosis fungoides occurs in about 1 in 100,000 to 350,000 individuals. It accounts for approximately 70 percent of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. For unknown reasons, mycosis fungoides affects males nearly twice as often as females. In the United States, there are an estimated 3.6 cases per million people each year. The condition has been found in regions around the world.
Description1: html:p Mycosis fungoides is the most common form of a type of blood cancer called  cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas occur when certain white  blood cells, called T cells, become cancerous; these cancers characteristically  affect the skin, causing different types of skin lesions. Although the skin is  involved, the skin cells themselves are not cancerous. Mycosis fungoides usually  occurs in adults over age 50, although affected children have been identified. html:p Mycosis fungoides may progress slowly through several stages, although not all  people with the condition progress through all stages. Most affected individuals  initially develop skin lesions called patches, which are flat, scaly, pink or  red areas on the skin that can be itchy. Cancerous T cells, which cause the  formation of patches, are found in these lesions. The skin cells themselves are  not cancerous; the skin problems result when cancerous T cells move from the  blood into the skin. Patches are most commonly found on the lower abdomen, upper  thighs, buttocks, and breasts. They can disappear and reappear or remain stable  over time. In some affected individuals, patches progress to plaques, the next  stage of mycosis fungoides. html:p Plaques are raised lesions that are usually reddish, purplish, or brownish in  color and itchy. Plaques commonly occur in the same body regions as patches.  While some plaques arise from patches, others develop on their own, and an  affected person can have both patches and plaques simultaneously. As with  patches, cancerous T cells are found in plaques. Plaques can remain stable or  can develop into tumors. Not everyone with patches or plaques develops tumors. html:p The tumors in mycosis fungoides, which are composed of cancerous T cells, are  raised nodules that are thicker and deeper than plaques. They can arise from  patches or plaques or occur on their own. Mycosis fungoides was so named because  the tumors can resemble mushrooms, a type of fungus. Common locations for tumor  development include the upper thighs and groin, breasts, armpits, and the crook  of the elbow. Open sores may develop on the tumors, often leading to infection. html:p Although rare, the cancerous T cells can spread to other organs, including the  lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and lungs. Spread to other organs can occur in any  stage of mycosis fungoides but is most common in the tumor stage. In addition,  affected individuals have an increased risk of developing another lymphoma or  other type of cancer.

Invasive  infections can also cause areas of tissue breakdown and pus production  (abscesses) on internal organs. In addition, affected individuals can have  localized infections of the ears, nose, or throat. Although fever is a common  reaction to bacterial infections, many people with MyD88 deficiency do not at  first develop a high fever in response to these infections, even if the  infection is severe.

frequency1: Myhre syndrome is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. At least 60 cases have been documented in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Myhre syndrome is a condition involving , characteristic facial  features, hearing loss, limited joint mobility, a buildup of scar tissue  (fibrosis) in the skin and internal organs, and other problems affecting  multiple body systems. Affected individuals often have problems with the heart  and blood vessels (cardiovascular system), the lungs and airways (respiratory  system), and the skeletal system. The cardiovascular and respiratory problems  gradually get worse and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.  Cancer also occasionally occurs in Myhre syndrome. html:p People with Myhre syndrome usually have  . Although intelligence can be normal  in affected individuals, most have  disability that ranges from mild  to moderate. Some people with this disorder have  issues such as  features of  affecting  and  interaction. Hearing loss occurs in most people with Myhre syndrome, usually  beginning in early childhood and gradually worsening; this hearing loss may not  be detected promptly and can contribute to  and  problems. html:p Fibrosis in Myhre syndrome can occur spontaneously or develop following surgery  or trauma. Affected individuals typically have stiff, thickened skin; this skin  condition may not be noticeable during infancy, but worsens over time. Usually  the skin changes first appear on the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet,  the back of the elbows, and the front of the knees. Eventually the skin thickens  on other parts of the body. As a result of the thicker skin, affected  individuals typically have fewer facial creases (wrinkles) than others of their  age. Fibrosis can also occur in the cardiovascular system, respiratory system,  and gastrointestinal tract, causing dysfunction in these systems. html:p Individuals with Myhre syndrome often have problems with the structure of the  heart that are present at birth (congenital s). Fibrosis in the  cardiovascular system can lead to the development of additional problems such as  ;  ;, which is the membrane that  surrounds the heart (constrictive pericarditis); or restrictive cardiomyopathy,  in which the heart muscle is stiff and cannot fully relax after each  contraction. html:p In Myhre syndrome, fibrosis of the respiratory tract can lead to narrowing of  the windpipe (laryngotracheal stenosis) and the passages leading from the  windpipe to the lungs (bronchi), high blood pressure in the vessels that carry  blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary arteries), damage to lung  tissue (interstitial pulmonary disease), and an impairment of lung expansion  (restrictive pulmonary disease). In the gastrointestinal tract, fibrosis can  result in narrowing of the lower part of the stomach (pyloric stenosis) or of  the upper part of the small intestine (duodenal strictures), or severe  constipation. html:p Growth is reduced in people with Myhre syndrome, beginning before birth and  continuing through adolescence. Affected individuals have a low birth weight and  are generally shorter than about 97 percent of their peers throughout life.  They have shortened long bones of the arms and legs, and unusually short fingers  and toes (brachydactyly). Other skeletal abnormalities associated with this  disorder include thickening of the skull bones, flattened bones of the spine  (platyspondyly), broad ribs, and  . Affected individuals often have joint  problems (arthropathy), including stiffness and limited mobility. html:p Typical facial features in people with Myhre syndrome include narrow openings of  the eyelids (short palpebral fissures), deeply set eyes, a shortened distance  between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum), a narrow mouth with a thin  upper lip, an underdeveloped upper jaw, and a protruding lower jaw  (prognathism). Some affected individuals are born with an opening in the roof of  the mouth (a cleft palate), a split in the lip (a cleft lip), or both.

Description1: html:p Myopathy with deficiency of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme is an inherited  disorder that primarily affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).  This condition does not usually affect other types of muscle, such as the heart  (cardiac) muscle. html:p From early childhood, affected individuals experience extreme fatigue in  response to physical activity (exercise intolerance).

However, people with this condition typically have normal muscle strength  when they are at rest. html:p Prolonged or recurrent physical activity causes more severe signs and symptoms,  including a breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). The destruction of  muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is processed by the  kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). Myoglobin causes the urine to  be red or brown. This protein can also damage the kidneys, in some cases  leading to life-threatening kidney failure. html:p In most affected individuals, the muscle problems associated with this condition  do not worsen with time. However, at least two people with a severe variant of  this disorder have experienced progressive muscle weakness and wasting starting  in childhood.

Description1: html:p Myotonia congenita is a disorder that affects muscles used for movement  (skeletal muscles). Beginning in childhood, people with this condition  experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles  from relaxing normally. Although myotonia can affect any skeletal muscles,  including muscles of the face and tongue, it occurs most often in the legs.  Myotonia causes muscle stiffness that can interfere with movement. In some  people the stiffness is very mild, while in other cases it may be severe enough  to interfere with walking, running, and other activities of daily life. These  muscle problems are particularly noticeable during movement following a period  of rest. Many affected individuals find that repeated movements can temporarily  alleviate their muscle stiffness, a phenomenon known as the warm-up effect. html:p The two major types of myotonia congenita are known as Thomsen disease and  Becker disease. These conditions are distinguished by the severity of their  symptoms and their patterns of inheritance. Becker disease usually appears later  in childhood than Thomsen disease and causes more severe muscle stiffness,  particularly in males. People with Becker disease often experience temporary  attacks of muscle weakness, particularly in the arms and hands, brought on by  movement after periods of rest. They may also develop mild, permanent muscle  weakness over time. This muscle weakness is not seen in people with Thomsen  disease.

Muscle weakness in type 2 primarily involves the muscles of the  neck, shoulders, elbows, and hips. The two types of myotonic dystrophy are  caused by mutations in different genes. html:p A variation of type 1 myotonic dystrophy, called congenital myotonic dystrophy,  is apparent at birth. Characteristic features include  (), an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot), breathing problems,  . Some of these health problems  can be life-threatening.

Many affected individuals have small or unusually formed ears,  and about 60 percent have hearing loss caused by defects in the middle ear  (conductive hearing loss). Nager syndrome does not affect a person's  intelligence, although   hearing  impairment. html:p Individuals with Nager syndrome have .  The most common abnormality is malformed or absent thumbs. Affected individuals  may also have fingers that are unusually curved (clinodactyly) or fused  together (syndactyly). Their forearms may be shortened due to the partial or  complete absence of a bone called the radius. People with Nager syndrome  sometimes have difficulty fully extending their elbows. This condition can also  cause bone abnormalities in the legs and feet. html:p Less commonly, affected individuals have abnormalities of the heart, kidneys,  , and urinary tract.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">The prevalence of nail-patella syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 50,000</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">individuals.</span>
Description1: html:p Nail-patella syndrome is characterized by abnormalities of the nails, knees,  elbows, and pelvis. The features of nail-patella syndrome vary in severity  between affected individuals, even among members of the same family. html:p Nail abnormalities are seen in almost all individuals with nail-patella  syndrome. The nails may be absent or underdeveloped and discolored, split,  ridged, or pitted. The fingernails are more likely to be affected than the  toenails, and the thumbnails are usually the most severely affected. In many  people with this condition, the areas at the base of the nails (lunulae) are  triangular instead of the usual crescent shape. html:p Individuals with nail-patella syndrome also commonly have skeletal abnormalities  involving the knees, elbows, and hips. The kneecaps (patellae) are small,  irregularly shaped, or absent, and dislocation of the patella is common. Some  people with this condition may not be able to fully extend their arms or turn  their palms up while keeping their elbows straight. The elbows may also be  angled outward (cubitus valgus) or have abnormal webbing. Many individuals with  nail-patella syndrome have horn-like outgrowths of the iliac bones of the pelvis  (iliac horns). These abnormal projections may be felt through the skin, but  they do not cause any symptoms and are usually detected on a pelvic x-ray. Iliac  horns are very common in people with nail-patella syndrome and are rarely, if  ever, seen in people without this condition. html:p Other areas of the body may also be affected in nail-patella syndrome,  particularly the eyes and kidneys. Individuals with this condition are at risk  of developing increased pressure within the eyes (glaucoma) at an early age.  Some people develop kidney disease, which can progress to kidney failure.

frequency1: Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome appears to be rare and has been described only in the Japanese population. About 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome is an inherited condition that affects many parts of  the body and has been described only in the Japanese population. Beginning in  infancy or early childhood, affected individuals develop red, swollen lumps  (nodular erythema) on the skin that occur most often in cold weather; recurrent  fevers; and elongated fingers and toes with widened and rounded tips (clubbing). html:p Later in childhood, affected individuals develop joint pain and  that limit movement, particularly in the hands,  wrists, and elbows. They also experience weakness and wasting of muscles, along  with a loss of fatty tissue (lipodystrophy), mainly in the upper body. The  combination of muscle and fat loss worsens over time, leading to an extremely  thin (emaciated) appearance in the face, chest, and arms. html:p Other signs and symptoms of Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome can include an enlarged  liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), a  reduced amount of blood cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytopenia), and  abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in an area of the brain called the  basal ganglia.  disability has been reported in some affected  individuals. html:p The signs and symptoms of Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome overlap with those of two  other conditions: one called , muscular atrophy, microcytic  anemia, and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome; and the other  called chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated  temperature (CANDLE) syndrome. All three conditions are characterized by skin  abnormalities and lipodystrophy. Although they are often considered separate  disorders, they are caused by mutations in the same gene, and some researchers  believe they may represent different forms of a single condition.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Narcolepsy affects about 1 in 2,000 people in the United States and Western</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Europe. However, the disorder is likely underdiagnosed, particularly in people</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">with mild symptoms. Worldwide, narcolepsy appears to be most common in Japan,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">where it affects an estimated 1 in 600 people.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that disrupts the normal sleep-wake</span>  cycle. Although this condition can appear at any age, it most often begins in  adolescence. html:p Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Affected  individuals feel tired during the day, and several times a day they may  experience an overwhelming urge to sleep."Sleep attacks"can occur at unusual  times, such as during a meal or in the middle of a conversation. They last from  a few seconds to a few minutes and often lead to a longer nap, after which  affected individuals wake up feeling refreshed. html:p Another common feature of narcolepsy is cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of  muscle tone in response to strong emotion (such as laughing, surprise, or  anger). These episodes of muscle weakness can cause an affected person to slump  over or fall, which occasionally leads to injury. Episodes of cataplexy usually  last just a few seconds, and they may occur from several times a day to a few  times a year. Most people diagnosed with narcolepsy also have cataplexy.  However, some do not, which has led researchers to distinguish two major forms  of the condition: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy. html:p Narcolepsy also affects nighttime sleep. Most affected individuals have trouble  sleeping for more than a few hours at night. They often experience vivid  hallucinations while falling asleep (hypnogogic hallucinations) or while waking  up (hypnopompic hallucinations). Affected individuals often have realistic and  distressing dreams, and they may act out their dreams by moving excessively or  talking in their sleep. Many people with narcolepsy also experience sleep  paralysis, which is an inability to move or speak for a short period while  falling asleep or awakening. The combination of hallucinations, vivid dreams,  and sleep paralysis is often frightening and unpleasant for affected  individuals. html:p Some people with narcolepsy have all of the major features of the disorder,  while others have only one or two. Most of the signs and symptoms persist  throughout life, although episodes of cataplexy may become less frequent with  age and treatment.

frequency1: Nemaline myopathy has an estimated incidence of 1 in 50,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Nemaline myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which  are muscles that the body uses for movement. People with nemaline myopathy have  muscle weakness (myopathy) throughout the body, but it is typically most severe  in the muscles of the face; neck; trunk; and other muscles close to the center  of the body (proximal muscles), such as those of the upper arms and legs. This  weakness can worsen over time. Affected individuals may have feeding and  swallowing difficulties, foot deformities, abnormal curvature of the spine  (scoliosis), and . Most people with nemaline  myopathy are able to walk, although some affected children may begin walking  later than usual. As the condition progresses, some people may require  wheelchair assistance. In severe cases, the muscles used for breathing are  affected and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur. html:p Nemaline myopathy is divided into six types. In order of decreasing severity,  the types are: severe congenital, Amish, intermediate congenital, typical  congenital, childhood-onset, and adult-onset. The types are distinguished by the  age when symptoms first appear and the severity of symptoms; however, there is  overlap among the various types. The severe congenital type is the most  life-threatening. Most individuals with this type do not survive past early  childhood due to respiratory failure. The Amish type solely affects the Old  Order Amish population of Pennsylvania and is typically fatal in early  childhood. The most common type of nemaline myopathy is the typical congenital  type, which is characterized by muscle weakness and feeding problems beginning  in infancy. Most of these individuals do not have severe breathing problems and  can walk unassisted. People with the childhood-onset type usually develop muscle  weakness in adolescence. The adult-onset type is the mildest of all the various  types. People with this type usually develop muscle weakness between ages 20  and 50.

Description1: html:p Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance. The body normally  balances fluid intake with the excretion of fluid in urine. However, people  with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus produce too much urine (polyuria), which  causes them to be excessively thirsty (polydipsia). Affected individuals can  quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water, especially in hot  weather or when they are sick. html:p Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be either acquired or hereditary. The  acquired form is brought on by certain drugs and chronic diseases and can occur  at any time during life. The hereditary form is caused by genetic mutations, and  its signs and symptoms usually become apparent within the first few months of  life. html:p Infants with hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may eat poorly and fail  to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They may also  be irritable and experience fevers, diarrhea, and vomiting. Recurrent episodes  of dehydration can lead to and . If the condition  is not well-managed, over time it can damage the bladder and kidneys leading to  pain, infections, and kidney failure. With appropriate treatment, affected  individuals usually have few complications and a normal lifespan. html:p Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should not be confused with diabetes mellitus,  which is much more common. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high blood  sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin or an  insensitivity to this hormone. Although nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and  diabetes mellitus have some features in common, they are separate disorders with  different causes.

frequency1: Nephronophthisis is found in populations worldwide. It occurs in an estimated 1 in 50,000 newborns in Canada, 1 in 100,000 in Finland, and 1 in 922,000 in the United States. Its incidence in other populations is unknown. Nephronophthisis is the most common genetic cause of ESRD in children and young adults.
Description1: html:p Nephronophthisis is a disorder that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by  inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) that impairs kidney function. These  abnormalities lead to increased urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst  (polydipsia), general weakness, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). In addition,  affected individuals develop fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, usually in an  area known as the corticomedullary region. Another feature of nephronophthisis  is a shortage of red blood cells, a condition known as anemia. html:p Nephronophthisis eventually leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a  life-threatening failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no  longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively.  Nephronophthisis can be classified by the approximate age at which ESRD begins:  around age 1 (infantile), around age 13 (juvenile), and around age 19  (adolescent). html:p About 85 percent of all cases of nephronophthisis are isolated, which means they  occur without other signs and symptoms. Some people with nephronophthisis have  additional features, which can include liver fibrosis, heart abnormalities, or  mirror image reversal of the position of one or more organs inside the body  (situs inversus). html:p Nephronophthisis can occur as part of separate syndromes that affect other areas  of the body; these are often referred to as nephronophthisis-associated  ciliopathies. For example, Senior-Løken syndrome is characterized by the  combination of nephronophthisis and a breakdown of the light-sensitive tissue at  the back of the eye (retinal degeneration); Joubert syndrome affects many parts  of the body, causing neurological problems and other features, which can  include nephronophthisis.

frequency1: Netherton syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 200,000 newborns.
Description1: html:p Netherton syndrome is a disorder that affects the skin, hair, and immune system.  Newborns with Netherton syndrome have skin that is red and scaly (ichthyosiform  erythroderma), and the skin may leak fluid. Some affected infants are born with  a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. This  membrane is usually shed during the first few weeks of life. Because newborns  with this disorder are missing the protection provided by normal skin, they are  at risk of becoming dehydrated and developing infections in the skin or  throughout the body (sepsis), which can be life-threatening. Affected babies may  also fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). The  health of older children and adults with Netherton syndrome usually improves,  although they often remain underweight and of . html:p After infancy, the severity of the skin abnormalities varies among people with  Netherton syndrome and can fluctuate over time. The skin may continue to be red  and scaly, especially during the first few years of life. Some affected  individuals have intermittent redness or experience outbreaks of a distinctive  skin abnormality called ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, involving patches of  multiple ring-like lesions. The triggers for the outbreaks are not known, but  researchers suggest that stress or infections may be involved. html:p Itchiness is a common problem for affected individuals, and scratching can lead  to frequent infections. Dead skin cells are shed at an abnormal rate and often  accumulate in the ear canals, which can affect hearing if not removed regularly.  The skin is abnormally absorbent of substances such as lotions and ointments,  which can result in excessive blood levels of some topical medications. Because  the ability of the skin to protect against heat and cold is impaired, affected  individuals may have difficulty regulating their body temperature. html:p People with Netherton syndrome have hair that is fragile and breaks easily. Some  strands of hair vary in diameter, with thicker and thinner spots. This feature  is known as bamboo hair, trichorrhexis nodosa, or trichorrhexis invaginata. In  addition to the hair on the scalp, the eyelashes and eyebrows may be affected.  The hair abnormality in Netherton syndrome may not be noticed in infancy because  babies often have sparse hair. html:p Most people with Netherton syndrome have immune system-related problems such as  food allergies, hay fever, asthma, or an inflammatory skin disorder called  eczema.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that most often affects children.</span>  Neuroblastoma occurs when immature nerve cells called neuroblasts become  abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Most commonly, the tumor  originates in the nerve tissue of the adrenal gland located above each kidney.  Other common sites for tumors to form include the nerve tissue in the abdomen,  chest, neck, or pelvis. Neuroblastoma can spread (metastasize) to other parts of  the body such as the bones, liver, or skin. html:p Individuals with neuroblastoma may develop general signs and symptoms such as  irritability, fever, tiredness (fatigue), pain, loss of appetite, weight loss,  or diarrhea. More specific signs and symptoms depend on the location of the  tumor and where it has spread. A tumor in the abdomen can cause abdominal  swelling. A tumor in the chest may lead to difficulty breathing. A tumor in the  neck can cause nerve damage known as Horner syndrome, which leads to drooping  eyelids, small pupils, decreased sweating, and red skin. Tumor metastasis to the  bone can cause bone pain, bruises, pale skin, or dark circles around the eyes.  Tumors in the backbone can press on the spinal cord and cause weakness,  numbness, or paralysis in the arms or legs. A rash of bluish or purplish bumps  that look like blueberries indicates that the neuroblastoma has spread to the  skin. html:p In addition, neuroblastoma tumors can release hormones that may cause other  signs and symptoms such as high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, flushing of the  skin, and sweating. In rare instances, individuals with neuroblastoma may  develop opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, which causes rapid eye movements and  jerky muscle motions. This condition occurs when the immune system malfunctions  and attacks nerve tissue. html:p Neuroblastoma occurs most often in children before age 5 and rarely occurs in  adults.

These spots increase in size and number as the  individual grows older. Freckles in the underarms and groin typically develop  later in childhood. html:p Most adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop neurofibromas, which are  noncancerous (benign) tumors that are usually located on or just under the skin.  These tumors may also occur in nerves near the spinal cord or along nerves  elsewhere in the body. Some people with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop  cancerous tumors that grow along nerves. These tumors, which usually develop in  adolescence or adulthood, are called malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.  People with neurofibromatosis type 1 also have an increased risk of developing  other cancers, including brain tumors and cancer of blood-forming tissue  (leukemia). html:p During childhood, benign growths called Lisch nodules often appear in the  colored part of the eye (the iris). Lisch nodules do not interfere with vision.  Some affected individuals also develop tumors that grow along the nerve leading  from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve). These tumors, which are called  optic gliomas, may lead to reduced vision or total vision loss.

Description1: html:p Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance. The body  normally balances fluid intake with the excretion of fluid in urine. However,  people with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus produce too much urine  (polyuria), which causes them to be excessively thirsty (polydipsia). Affected  people need to urinate frequently, which can disrupt daily activities and sleep. html:p People with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus can quickly become dehydrated if  they do not drink enough water. Dehydration can lead to constipation and dry  skin. If the disorder is not treated, more serious complications of dehydration  can occur. These include confusion, low blood pressure, , and coma. html:p Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus can be either acquired or familial. The  acquired form is brought on by injuries, tumors, and other factors, and can  occur at any time during life. The familial form is caused by genetic mutations;  its signs and symptoms usually become apparent in childhood and worsen over  time. html:p Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus should not be confused with diabetes  mellitus, which is much more common. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high  blood sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin or an  insensitivity to this hormone.

frequency1: Neuromyelitis optica affects approximately 1 to 2 per 100,000 people worldwide. Women are affected by this condition more frequently than men.
Description1: html:p Neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves of the  eyes and the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord.  Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the  body's own tissues and organs. In neuromyelitis optica, the autoimmune attack  causes inflammation of the nerves, and the resulting damage leads to the signs  and symptoms of the condition. html:p Neuromyelitis optica is characterized by optic neuritis, which is inflammation  of the nerve that carries information from the eye to the brain (optic nerve).  Optic neuritis causes eye pain and vision loss, which can occur in one or both  eyes. html:p Neuromyelitis optica is also characterized by transverse myelitis, which is  inflammation of the spinal cord. The inflammation associated with transverse  myelitis damages the spinal cord, causing a lesion that often extends the length  of three or more bones of the spine (vertebrae). In addition, myelin, which is  the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of  nerve impulses, can be damaged. Transverse myelitis causes weakness, numbness,  and paralysis of the arms and legs. Other effects of spinal cord damage can  include disturbances in sensations, loss of bladder and bowel control,  uncontrollable hiccupping, and nausea. In addition, muscle weakness may make  breathing difficult and can cause life-threatening respiratory failure in people  with neuromyelitis optica. html:p There are two forms of neuromyelitis optica, the relapsing form and the  monophasic form. The relapsing form is most common. This form is characterized  by recurrent episodes of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. These episodes  can be months or years apart, and there is usually partial recovery between  episodes. However, most affected individuals eventually develop permanent muscle  weakness and vision impairment that persist even between episodes. For unknown  reasons, approximately nine times more women than men have the relapsing form.  The monophasic form, which is less common, causes a single episode of  neuromyelitis optica that can last several months. People with this form of the  condition can also have lasting muscle weakness or paralysis and vision loss.  This form affects men and women equally. The onset of either form of  neuromyelitis optica can occur anytime from childhood to adulthood, although the  condition most frequently begins in a person's forties. html:p Approximately one-quarter of individuals with neuromyelitis optica have signs or  symptoms of another autoimmune disorder such as myasthenia gravis, systemic  lupus erythematosus, or Sjögren syndrome. Some scientists believe that a  condition described in Japanese patients as optic-spinal multiple sclerosis (or  opticospinal multiple sclerosis) that affects the nerves of the eyes and central  nervous system is the same as neuromyelitis optica.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/niemann-pick-disease
frequency1: Niemann-Pick disease types A and B is estimated to affect 1 in 250,000 individuals. Niemann-Pick disease type A occurs more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish descent than in the general population. The incidence within the Ashkenazi population is approximately 1 in 40,000 individuals.Combined, Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are estimated to affect 1 in 150,000 individuals; however, type C1 is by far the more common type, accounting for 95 percent of cases. The disease occurs more frequently in people of French-Acadian descent in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, a population of affected French-Acadians were previously designated as having Niemann-Pick disease type D, however, it was shown that these individuals have mutations in the gene associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C1.
Description1: html:p Niemann-Pick disease is a condition that affects many body systems. It has a  wide range of symptoms that vary in severity. Niemann-Pick disease is divided  into four main types: type A, type B, type C1, and type C2. These types are  classified on the basis of genetic cause and the signs and symptoms of the  condition. html:p Infants with Niemann-Pick disease type A usually develop an enlarged liver and  spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) by age 3 months and fail to gain weight and grow at  the expected rate (failure to thrive). The affected children develop normally  until around age 1 year when they experience a progressive loss of mental  abilities and movement (psychomotor regression). Children with Niemann-Pick  disease type A also develop widespread lung damage (interstitial lung disease)  that can cause recurrent lung infections and eventually lead to respiratory  failure. All affected children have an eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot,  which can be identified with an eye examination. Children with Niemann-Pick  disease type A generally do not survive past early childhood. html:p Niemann-Pick disease type B usually presents in mid-childhood. The signs and  symptoms of this type are similar to type A, but not as severe. People with  Niemann-Pick disease type B often have hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent lung  infections, and a low number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). They  also have  and slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age).  About one-third of affected individuals have the cherry-red spot eye abnormality  or neurological impairment. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B usually  survive into adulthood. html:p The signs and symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are very similar;  these types differ only in their genetic cause. Niemann-Pick disease types C1  and C2 usually become apparent in childhood, although signs and symptoms can  develop at any time. People with these types usually develop difficulty  s , an inability to move the eyes vertically  (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), , severe liver  disease, and interstitial lung disease. Individuals with Niemann-Pick disease  types C1 and C2 have problems with  and swallowing that worsen over time,  eventually interfering with feeding. Affected individuals often experience  progressive decline in  function and about one-third have .  People with these types may survive into adulthood.

frequency1: The exact prevalence of Nijmegen breakage syndrome is unknown. This condition is estimated to affect one in 100,000 newborns worldwide, but is thought to be most common in the Slavic populations of Eastern Europe.
Description1: html:p Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a condition characterized by , an  unusually small head size (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, recurrent  respiratory tract infections, an increased risk of cancer,  disability, and other health problems. html:p People with this condition typically  . After this period of , affected individuals grow at a  normal rate but remain shorter than their peers. Microcephaly is apparent from  birth in the majority of affected individuals. The head does not grow at the  same rate as the rest of the body, so it appears that the head is getting  smaller as the body grows (progressive microcephaly). Individuals with Nijmegen  breakage syndrome have distinctive facial features that include a sloping  forehead, a prominent nose, large ears, a small jaw, and outside corners of the  eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures). These facial features  typically become apparent by age 3. html:p People with Nijmegen breakage syndrome have a malfunctioning immune system  (immunodeficiency) with abnormally low levels of immune system proteins called  immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA). Affected individuals also  have a shortage of immune system cells called T cells. The immune system  abnormalities increase susceptibility to recurrent infections, such as  bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, and other infections affecting the upper  respiratory tract and lungs. html:p Individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome have an increased risk of developing  cancer, most commonly a cancer of immune system cells called non-Hodgkin  lymphoma. About half of individuals with Nijmegen breakage syndrome develop  non-Hodgkin lymphoma, usually before age 15. Other cancers seen in people with  Nijmegen breakage syndrome include brain tumors such as medulloblastoma and  glioma, and a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma. People with  Nijmegen breakage syndrome are 50 times more likely to develop cancer than  people without this condition. html:p development is normal in most people with this condition for the  first year or two of life, but then . Skills decline  over time, and most affected children and adults have mild to moderate  disability. html:p Most affected woman have premature ovarian failure and do not begin menstruation  by age 16 (primary amenorrhea) or have infrequent menstrual periods. Most women  with Nijmegen breakage syndrome are unable to have biological children  (infertile).

GHR-webpage1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease</span>
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">NAFLD is a very common disorder, occurring in about 25 percent of the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">global population. Its prevalence is increasing along with the rising prevalence</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">of obesity in industrialized societies, and it is now the most common chronic</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">liver disorder in Western countries, including the United States. NAFLD is more</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">prevalent in individuals of Hispanic, Native American, or Asian ancestry than in</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">individuals of European or African ancestry.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a buildup of excessive fat in the</span>  liver that can lead to liver damage resembling the damage caused by alcohol  abuse, but that occurs in people who do not drink heavily. The liver is a part  of the digestive system that helps break down food, store energy, and remove  waste products, including toxins. The liver normally contains some fat; an  individual is considered to have a fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) if the liver  contains more than 5 to 10 percent fat. html:p The fat deposits in the liver associated with NAFLD usually cause no symptoms,  although they may cause increased levels of liver enzymes that are detected in  routine blood tests. Some affected individuals have abdominal pain or fatigue.  During a physical examination, the liver may be found to be slightly enlarged. html:p Between 7 and 30 percent of people with NAFLD develop inflammation of the liver  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, also known as NASH), leading to liver damage.  Minor damage to the liver can be repaired by the body. However, severe or  long-term damage can lead to the replacement of normal liver tissue with scar  tissue (fibrosis), resulting in irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis) that  causes the liver to stop working properly. Signs and symptoms of cirrhosis,  which get worse as fibrosis affects more of the liver, include fatigue,  weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, swelling (edema), and yellowing  of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Scarring in the vein that  carries blood into the liver from the other digestive organs (the portal vein)  can lead to increased pressure in that blood vessel (portal hypertension),  resulting in swollen blood vessels (varices) within the digestive system.  Rupture of these varices can cause life-threatening bleeding. html:p NAFLD and NASH are thought to account for many cases of cirrhosis that have no  obvious underlying cause (cryptogenic cirrhosis); at least one-third of people  with NASH eventually develop cirrhosis. People with NAFLD, NASH, and cirrhosis  are also at increased risk of developing liver cancer (hepatocellular cancer). html:p NAFLD is most common in middle-aged or older people, although younger people,  including children, are also affected. It is often considered as part of a group  of conditions known collectively as the metabolic syndrome; in addition to  NAFLD, the metabolic syndrome includes obesity, type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes  (insulin resistance), high levels of fats (lipids) such as cholesterol and  triglycerides in the blood, and high blood pressure (hypertension). However, a  person with NAFLD may not have all or any of the other conditions that make up  the metabolic syndrome, and individuals with some or all of those conditions may  not have NAFLD.

Description1: html:p Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE) is a condition that  mainly affects the skin. Many infants with this condition are born with a tight,  clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. Constriction by  the membrane may cause the lips and eyelids to be turned out so the inner  surface is exposed. The collodion membrane is usually shed during the first few  weeks of life. Following shedding of the collodion membrane, the skin is red  (erythroderma) and covered with fine, white scales (ichthyosis). Infants with  NBCIE may develop infections, an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration), and  respiratory problems early in life. html:p Some people with NBCIE have thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and  soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma), decreased or absent sweating  (anhidrosis), and abnormal nails (nail dystrophy). In severe cases, there is an  absence of hair growth (alopecia) in certain areas, often affecting the scalp  and eyebrows. html:p In individuals with NBCIE, some of the skin problems may improve by adulthood.  Life expectancy is normal in people with NBCIE.

Description1: html:p Nonsyndromic aplasia cutis congenita is a condition in which babies are born  with localized areas of missing skin (lesions). These areas resemble ulcers or  open wounds, although they are sometimes already healed at birth. Lesions most  commonly occur on the top of the head (skull vertex), although they can be found  on the torso or limbs. In some cases, the bone and other tissues under the skin  defect are also underdeveloped. html:p Most affected babies have a single lesion. The lesions vary in size and can be  differently shaped: some are round or oval, others rectangular, and still others  star-shaped. They usually leave a scar after they heal. When the scalp is  involved, there may be an absence of hair growth (alopecia) in the affected  area. html:p When the underlying bone and other tissues are involved, affected individuals  are at higher risk of infections. If these severe defects occur on the head, the  membrane that covers the brain (the dura mater) may be exposed, and  life-threatening bleeding may occur from nearby vessels. html:p Skin lesions are typically the only feature of nonsyndromic aplasia cutis  congenita, although other skin problems and abnormalities of the bones and other  tissues occur rarely. However, the characteristic skin lesions can occur as one  of many symptoms in other conditions, including Johanson-Blizzard syndrome and  Adams-Oliver syndrome. These instances are described as syndromic aplasia cutis  congenita.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Between 2 and 3 per 1,000 children in the United States are born with</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">detectable hearing loss in one or both ears. The prevalence of hearing loss</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">increases with age; the condition affects 1 in 8 people in the United States age</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">12 and older, or about 30 million people. By age 85, more than half of all</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">people experience hearing loss.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Nonsyndromic hearing loss is a partial or total loss of hearing that is not</span>  associated with other signs and symptoms. In contrast, syndromic hearing loss  occurs with signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body. html:p Nonsyndromic hearing loss can be classified in several different ways. One  common way is by the condition's pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant  (DFNA), autosomal recessive (DFNB), X-linked (DFNX), or mitochondrial (which  does not have a special designation). Each of these types of hearing loss  includes multiple subtypes. DFNA, DFNB, and DFNX subtypes are numbered in the  order in which they were first described. For example, DFNA1 was the first type  of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss to be identified. html:p The characteristics of nonsyndromic hearing loss vary among the different types.  Hearing loss can affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). Degrees  of hearing loss range from mild (difficulty understanding soft ) to  profound (inability to hear even very loud noises). The term"deafness"is often  used to describe severe-to-profound hearing loss. Hearing loss can be stable,  or it may be progressive, becoming more severe as a person gets older.  Particular types of nonsyndromic hearing loss show distinctive patterns of  hearing loss. For example, the loss may be more pronounced at high, middle, or  low tones. html:p Most forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss are described as sensorineural, which  means they are associated with a permanent loss of hearing caused by damage to  structures in the inner ear. The inner ear processes sound and sends the  information to the brain in the form of electrical nerve impulses. Less  commonly, nonsyndromic hearing loss is described as conductive, meaning it  results from changes in the middle ear. The middle ear contains three tiny bones  that help transfer sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Some forms of  nonsyndromic hearing loss, particularly a type called DFNX2, involve changes in  both the inner ear and the middle ear. This combination is called mixed hearing  loss. html:p Depending on the type, nonsyndromic hearing loss can become apparent at any time  from infancy to old age. Hearing loss that is present before a child learns to  speak is classified as prelingual or congenital. That occurs after  the development of  is classified as postlingual.

Name1: Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/nonsyndromic-holoprosencephaly
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly accounts for approximately 25 to 50 percent</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">of all cases of holoprosencephaly, which affects an estimated 1 in 10,000</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">newborns.</span>
Description1: html:p Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly is that also  affects the head and face. Normally, the brain divides into two halves  (hemispheres) during early development. Holoprosencephaly occurs when the brain  fails to divide properly into the right and left hemispheres. This condition is  called nonsyndromic to distinguish it from other types of holoprosencephaly  caused by genetic syndromes, chromosome abnormalities, or substances that cause  birth defects (teratogens). The severity of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly  varies widely among affected individuals, even within the same family. html:p Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly can be grouped into four types according to the  degree of brain division. From most to least severe, the types are known as  alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant (MIHV). In the  most severe forms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly, the brain does not divide  at all. These affected individuals have one central eye (cyclopia) and a tubular  nasal structure (proboscis) located above the eye. Most babies with severe  nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly die before birth or soon after. In the less  severe forms, the brain is partially divided and the eyes are usually set close  together (hypotelorism). The life expectancy of these affected individuals  varies depending on the severity of symptoms. html:p People with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly often have a small head  (microcephaly), although they can develop a buildup of fluid in the brain  (hydrocephalus) that causes increased head size (macrocephaly). Other features  may include an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) with or without a  split in the upper lip (cleft lip), one central front tooth instead of two (a  single maxillary central incisor), and a flat nasal bridge. The eyeballs may be  abnormally small (microphthalmia) or absent (anophthalmia). html:p Some individuals with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly have a distinctive pattern  of facial features, including a narrowing of the head at the temples, outside  corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures), large  ears, a short nose with upturned nostrils, and a broad and deep space between  the nose and mouth (philtrum). In general, the severity of facial features is  directly related to the severity of the brain abnormalities. However,  individuals with mildly affected facial features can have severe brain  abnormalities. Some people do not have apparent structural brain abnormalities  but have some of the facial features associated with this condition. These  individuals are considered to have a form of the disorder known as microform  holoprosencephaly and are typically identified after the birth of a severely  affected family member. html:p Most people with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly have  . Affected individuals also frequently have a  malfunctioning pituitary gland, which is a gland located at the base of the  brain that produces several hormones. Because pituitary dysfunction leads to the  partial or complete absence of these hormones, it can cause a variety of  disorders. Most commonly, people with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly and  pituitary dysfunction develop diabetes insipidus, a condition that disrupts the  balance between fluid intake and urine excretion. Dysfunction in other parts of  the brain can cause , feeding difficulties, and problems regulating body  temperature, heart rate, and breathing. The sense of smell may be diminished  (hyposmia) or completely absent (anosmia) if the part of the brain that  processes smells is underdeveloped or missing.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/nonsyndromic-paraganglioma
frequency1: It is estimated that the prevalence of pheochromocytoma is 1 in 500,000 people, and the prevalence of other paragangliomas is 1 in 1 million people. These statistics include syndromic and nonsyndromic paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma.
Description1: html:p Paraganglioma is a type of noncancerous (benign) tumor that occurs in structures  called paraganglia. Paraganglia are groups of cells that are found near nerve  cell bunches called ganglia. Paragangliomas are usually found in the head, neck,  or torso. However, a type of paraganglioma known as pheochromocytoma develops  in the adrenal glands. Adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney and  produce hormones in response to stress. Most people with paraganglioma develop  only one tumor in their lifetime. html:p Some people develop a paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma as part of a hereditary  syndrome that may affect other organs and tissues in the body. However, the  tumors often are not associated with any syndromes, in which case the condition  is called nonsyndromic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma. html:p Pheochromocytomas and some other paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of  the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system controls the  "fight-or-flight"response, a series of changes in the body due to hormones  released in response to stress. Although most sympathetic paragangliomas are  pheochromocytomas, some are found outside the adrenal glands, usually in the  abdomen, and are called extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Most sympathetic  paragangliomas, including pheochromocytomas, produce hormones called  catecholamines, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine. These excess  catecholamines can cause signs and symptoms such as high blood pressure  (hypertension), episodes of rapid heartbeat (palpitations), headaches, or  sweating. html:p Most paragangliomas are associated with ganglia of the parasympathetic nervous  system, which controls involuntary body functions such as digestion and saliva  formation. Parasympathetic paragangliomas, typically found in the head and neck,  usually do not produce hormones. However, large tumors may cause signs and  symptoms such as coughing, hearing loss in one ear, or difficulty swallowing. html:p Although most paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are noncancerous, some can  become cancerous (malignant) and spread to other parts of the body  (metastasize). Extra-adrenal paragangliomas become malignant more often than  other types of paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma.

It is</span>  characterized by mildly unusual facial features, , s,  bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms. html:p People with Noonan syndrome have distinctive facial features such as a deep  groove in the area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), widely spaced eyes  that are usually pale blue or blue-green in color, and low-set ears that are  rotated backward. Affected individuals may have a high arch in the roof of the  mouth (high-arched palate), poor teeth alignment, and a small lower jaw  (micrognathia). Many children with Noonan syndrome have a short neck, and both  children and adults may have excess neck skin (also called webbing) and a low  hairline at the back of the neck. html:p Between 50 and 70 percent of individuals with Noonan syndrome have  . At birth, they are usually a normal length and weight, but  over time. Abnormal levels of growth hormone, a protein that is necessary for  the normal growth of the body's bones and tissues, may contribute to the   html:p Individuals with Noonan syndrome often have either a sunken chest (pectus  excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Some affected people may  also have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). html:p Most people with Noonan syndrome have some form of critical congenital heart  disease. The most common  in these individuals is a narrowing of the  valve that controls blood flow from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valve  stenosis). Some have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which enlarges and weakens the  heart muscle. html:p A variety of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan syndrome. Some  affected individuals have excessive bruising, nosebleeds, or prolonged bleeding  following injury or surgery. Rarely, women with Noonan syndrome who have a  bleeding disorder have excessive bleeding during menstruation (menorrhagia) or  childbirth. html:p Adolescent males with Noonan syndrome typically experience delayed puberty. They  go through puberty starting at age 13 or 14 and have a  spurt that results in . Most males with Noonan syndrome have  undescended testes (cryptorchidism), which may contribute to infertility  (inability to father a child) later in life. Females with Noonan syndrome can  experience delayed puberty but most have normal puberty and fertility. html:p Noonan syndrome can cause a variety of other signs and symptoms. Most children  diagnosed with Noonan syndrome have normal intelligence, but a few have special  educational needs, and some have  disability. Some affected  individuals have vision or hearing problems. Affected infants may have feeding  problems, which typically get better by age 1 or 2 years. Infants with Noonan  syndrome may be born with puffy hands and feet caused by a buildup of fluid  (lymphedema), which can go away on its own. Older individuals can also develop  lymphedema, usually in the ankles and lower legs. html:p Some people with Noonan syndrome develop cancer, particularly those involving  the blood-forming cells (leukemia). It has been estimated that children with  Noonan syndrome have an eightfold increased risk of developing leukemia or other  cancers over age-matched peers. html:p Noonan syndrome is one of a group of related conditions, collectively known as  RASopathies. These conditions all have similar signs and symptoms and are caused  by changes in the same cell signaling pathway. In addition to Noonan syndrome,  the RASopathies include cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome,  neurofibromatosis type 1, Legius syndrome, and Noonan syndrome with multiple  lentigines.

Name1: Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/noonan-syndrome-with-multiple-lentigines
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines is thought to be a rare condition;</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">approximately 200 cases have been reported worldwide.</span>
Description1: html:p Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (formerly called LEOPARD syndrome) is a  condition that affects many areas of the body. As the condition name suggests,  Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines is very similar to a condition called  Noonan syndrome, and it can be difficult to tell the two disorders apart in  early childhood. However, the features of these two conditions differ later in  life. The characteristic features of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines  include brown skin spots called lentigines that are similar to freckles, heart  defects, widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), a sunken chest (pectus  excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum), and . These  features vary, however, even among affected individuals in the same family. Not  all individuals with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines have all the  characteristic features of this condition. html:p The lentigines seen in Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines typically first  appear in mid-childhood, mostly on the face, neck, and upper body. Affected  individuals may have thousands of small dark brown skin spots by the time they  reach puberty. Unlike freckles, the appearance of lentigines has nothing to do  with sun exposure. In addition to lentigines, people with this condition may  have lighter brown skin spots called café-au-lait spots. Café-au-lait spots tend  to develop before the lentigines, appearing within the first year of life in  most affected people. html:p Of the people with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines who have heart  defects, about 80 percent have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a  thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump  blood. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy most often affects the lower left chamber  of the heart (the left ventricle). Up to 20 percent of people with Noonan  syndrome with multiple lentigines who have heart problems have a narrowing of  the artery from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary stenosis). html:p People with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines can have a distinctive  facial appearance. In addition to ocular hypertelorism, affected individuals may  have droopy eyelids (ptosis), thick lips, and low-set ears. Affected  individuals also usually have an abnormal appearance of the chest; they either  have pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum. html:p At birth, people with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines are typically of  normal weight and height, but in some, . This  results in affected individuals being shorter than average, although less than  half of people with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines have significantly  . html:p Other signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines include  hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness),  mild  disability, and extra folds of skin on the back of the neck.  Affected males often have , which can include undescended  testes (cryptorchidism) and a  . These abnormalities may reduce the ability to have biological  children (decreased fertility). Females with Noonan syndrome with multiple  lentigines may have poorly developed ovaries and delayed puberty. html:p Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines is one of a group of related conditions  collectively known as RASopathies. These conditions all have similar signs and  symptoms and are caused by changes in the same cell signaling pathway. In  addition to Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, the RASopathies include  Noonan syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome,  neurofibromatosis type 1, and Legius syndrome.

Description1: html:p Ochoa syndrome is a disorder characterized by urinary problems and unusual  facial expressions. html:p The urinary problems associated with Ochoa syndrome typically become apparent in  early childhood or adolescence. People with this disorder may have difficulty  controlling the flow of urine (incontinence), which can lead to bedwetting.  Individuals with Ochoa syndrome may be unable to completely empty the bladder,  often resulting in vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine backs up  into the ducts that normally carry it from each kidney to the bladder (the  ureters). Urine may also accumulate in the kidneys (hydronephrosis).  Vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis can lead to frequent infections of the  urinary tract and kidney inflammation (pyelonephritis), causing damage that may  eventually result in kidney failure. html:p Individuals with Ochoa syndrome also exhibit a characteristic frown-like facial  grimace when they try to smile or laugh, often described as inversion of facial  expression. While this feature may appear earlier than the urinary tract  symptoms, perhaps as early as an infant begins to smile, it is often not brought  to medical attention. html:p Approximately two-thirds of individuals with Ochoa syndrome also experience  problems with bowel function, such as constipation, loss of bowel control, or  muscle spasms of the anus.

The classic signs and symptoms of this condition are</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">much less common in females.</span>
Description1: html:p Ocular albinism is a genetic condition that primarily affects the eyes. This  condition reduces the coloring (pigmentation) of the iris, which is the colored  part of the eye, and the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back  of the eye. Pigmentation in the eye is essential for normal vision. html:p Ocular albinism is characterized by severely impaired sharpness of vision  (visual acuity) and problems with combining vision from both eyes to perceive  depth (stereoscopic vision). Although the vision loss is permanent, it does not  worsen over time. Other eye abnormalities associated with this condition include  rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); eyes that do not look in the same  direction (strabismus); and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Many  affected individuals also have abnormalities involving the optic nerves, which  carry visual information from the eye to the brain. html:p Unlike some other forms of albinism, ocular albinism does not significantly  affect the color of the skin and hair. People with this condition may have a  somewhat lighter complexion than other members of their family, but these  differences are usually minor. html:p The most common form of ocular albinism is known as the Nettleship-Falls type or  type 1. Other forms of ocular albinism are much rarer and may be associated  with additional signs and symptoms, such as hearing loss.

frequency1: Overall, an estimated 1 in 20,000 people worldwide are born with oculocutaneous albinism. The condition affects people in many ethnic groups and geographical regions. Types 1 and 2 are the most common forms of this condition; types 3 and 4 are less common. Type 2 occurs more frequently in African Americans, some Native American groups, and people from sub-Saharan Africa. Type 3, specifically rufous oculocutaneous albinism, has been described primarily in people from southern Africa. Studies suggest that type 4 occurs more frequently in the Japanese and Korean populations than in people from other parts of the world.
Description1: html:p Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of conditions that affect coloring  (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have  very fair skin and white or light-colored hair. Long-term sun exposure greatly  increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancers, including an  form of skin cancer called melanoma, in people with this condition.  Oculocutaneous albinism also reduces pigmentation of the colored part of the eye  (the iris) and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina).  People with this condition usually have vision problems such as reduced  sharpness; rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); and increased  sensitivity to light (photophobia). html:p Researchers have identified multiple types of oculocutaneous albinism, which are  distinguished by their specific skin, hair, and eye color changes and by their  genetic cause. Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 is characterized by white hair,  very pale skin, and light-colored irises. Type 2 is typically less severe than  type 1; the skin is usually a creamy white color and hair may be light yellow,  blond, or light brown. Type 3 includes a form of albinism called rufous  oculocutaneous albinism, which usually affects dark-skinned people. Affected  individuals have reddish-brown skin, ginger or red hair, and hazel or brown  irises. Type 3 is often associated with milder vision abnormalities than the  other forms of oculocutaneous albinism. Type 4 has signs and symptoms similar to  those seen with type 2. html:p Several additional types of this disorder have been proposed, each affecting one  or a few families.

frequency1: Ollier disease is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000 people.
Description1: html:p Ollier disease is a disorder characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are  noncancerous (benign) growths of cartilage that develop within the bones. These  growths most commonly occur in the limb bones, especially in the bones of the  hands and feet; however, they may also occur in the skull, ribs, and bones of  the spine (vertebrae). Enchondromas may result in severe bone deformities,  shortening of the limbs, and fractures. html:p The signs and symptoms of Ollier disease may be detectable at birth, although  they generally do not become apparent until around the age of 5. Enchondromas  develop near the ends of bones, where normal growth occurs, and they frequently  stop forming after affected individuals stop growing in early adulthood. As a  result of the bone deformities associated with Ollier disease, people with this  disorder generally have  and underdeveloped muscles. html:p Although the enchondromas associated with Ollier disease start out as benign,  they may become cancerous (malignant). In particular, affected individuals may  develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. People  with Ollier disease also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as  ovarian or liver cancer. html:p People with Ollier disease usually have a normal lifespan, and intelligence is  unaffected. The extent of their physical impairment depends on their individual  skeletal deformities, but in most cases they have no major limitations in their  activities. html:p A related disorder called Maffucci syndrome also involves multiple enchondromas  but is distinguished by the presence of red or purplish growths in the skin  consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas).

Description1: html:p Omenn syndrome is an inherited disorder of the immune system (immunodeficiency).  Omenn syndrome is one of several forms of severe combined immunodeficiency  (SCID), a group of disorders that cause individuals to have virtually no immune  protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Individuals with SCID are prone to  repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or  life-threatening. Infants with Omenn syndrome typically experience pneumonia and  chronic diarrhea. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with this  disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause  illness in healthy people. html:p In addition to immunodeficiency, children with Omenn syndrome develop  autoimmunity, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and  organs. This abnormal immune reaction can cause very red skin (erythroderma),  hair loss (alopecia), and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). In  addition, affected individuals have enlargement of tissues that produce  infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes. These include the  thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone, and lymph nodes, which  are found throughout the body. html:p If not treated in a way that restores immune function, children with Omenn  syndrome usually survive only until age 1 or 2.

The prevalence</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">of opioid misuse and addiction is rapidly increasing.In 2016, more than 20,000</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">deaths in the United States were caused by an overdose of prescription opioids,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">and another 13,000 deaths resulted from heroin overdose. Drug overdoses are now</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">the leading cause of death in U.S. adults under age 50, and opioids account for</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">more than half of all drug overdose deaths.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Opioid addiction is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that can cause major</span>  health, , and economic problems. Opioids are a class of drugs that act in  the nervous system to produce feelings of pleasure and pain relief. Some opioids  are legally prescribed by healthcare providers to manage severe and chronic  pain. Commonly prescribed opioids include oxycodone, fentanyl, buprenorphine,  methadone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine. Some other opioids,  such as heroin, are illegal drugs of abuse. html:p Opioid addiction is characterized by a powerful, compulsive urge to use opioid  drugs, even when they are no longer required medically. Opioids have a high  potential for causing addiction in some people, even when the medications are  prescribed appropriately and taken as directed. Many prescription opioids are  misused or diverted to others. Individuals who become addicted may prioritize  getting and using these drugs over other activities in their lives, often  negatively impacting their professional and personal relationships. It is  unknown why some people are more likely to become addicted than others. html:p Opioids change the chemistry of the brain and lead to drug tolerance, which  means that over time the dose needs to be increased to achieve the same effect.  Taking opioids over a long period of time produces dependence, such that when  people stop taking the drug, they have physical and psychological symptoms of  withdrawal (such as muscle cramping, diarrhea, and ). Dependence is not  the same thing as addiction; although everyone who takes opioids for an extended  period will become dependent, only a small percentage also experience the  compulsive, continuing need for the drug that characterizes addiction. html:p Opioid addiction can cause life-threatening health problems, including the risk  of overdose. Overdose occurs when high doses of opioids cause breathing to slow  or stop, leading to unconsciousness and death if the overdose is not treated  immediately. Both legal and illegal opioids carry a risk of overdose if a person  takes too much of the drug, or if opioids are combined with other drugs  (particularly tranquilizers called benzodiazepines).

There are two  forms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome, X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome and autosomal  dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome. The two forms are distinguished by their genetic  causes and patterns of inheritance. The signs and symptoms of the two forms are  generally the same. html:p Nearly everyone with Opitz G/BBB syndrome has wide-spaced eyes (ocular  hypertelorism). Affected individuals commonly have defects of the voice box  (larynx), windpipe (trachea), or esophagus. These throat abnormalities can cause  difficulty swallowing or breathing, in some cases resulting in recurrent  pneumonia or life-threatening breathing problems. A common defect is a gap  between the trachea and esophagus (laryngeal cleft) that allows food or fluids  to enter the airway. The cleft can vary in size, and infants may struggle to  breathe when feeding. Most males with Opitz G/BBB syndrome have  such as the  , undescended testes (cryptorchidism), an underdeveloped scrotum,  or a scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum). These  can lead to problems in the urinary tract. html:p Mild   occur in about 50 percent  of people with Opitz G/BBB syndrome. Affected individuals have delayed motor  skills, such as walking,  delay, and  difficulties. Some people  with Opitz G/BBB syndrome have features of autistic spectrum disorders, which  are characterized by impaired  and ization skills. About half  of affected individuals also have an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or  without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Some have cleft  palate without cleft lip. Less common features of Opitz G/BBB syndrome,  affecting less than half of people with this disorder, include minor heart  defects, an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus), and brain  defects such as a small or absent connection between the left and right halves  of the brain (corpus callosum). Distinct facial features that may be seen in  this disorder include a prominent forehead, widow's peak hairline, flat nasal  bridge, thin upper lip, and low-set ears. These features vary among affected  individuals, even within the same family.

Description1: html:p Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that often causes slowly worsening vision,  usually beginning in childhood. People with optic atrophy type 1 typically  experience a narrowing of their field of vision (tunnel vision). Affected  individuals gradually lose their sight as their field of vision becomes smaller.  Both eyes are usually affected equally, but the severity of the vision loss  varies widely, even among affected members of the same family, ranging from  nearly normal vision to complete blindness. html:p In addition to vision loss, people with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have  problems with color vision (color vision deficiency) that make it difficult or  impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green. html:p In the early stages of the condition, individuals with optic atrophy type 1  experience a progressive loss of certain cells within the retina, which is a  specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The loss of  these cells (known as retinal ganglion cells) is followed by the degeneration  (atrophy) of the nerves that relay visual information from the eye to the brain  (optic nerves), which results in further vision loss. Atrophy causes these  nerves to have an abnormally pale appearance (pallor), which can be seen during  an eye examination.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ornithine-transcarbamylase-deficiency
frequency1: Estimates of the prevalence of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency have ranged from 1 in 14,000 to 1 in 77,000 people. Individuals with the neonatal-onset form of the disorder are more likely to be counted in these estimates, because people with the late-onset form are less likely to come to medical attention.
Description1: html:p Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes  ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are  broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous  system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. html:p Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency can become evident at any age. The most  severe form occurs in the first few days of life. This neonatal-onset form of  the disorder usually affects males; it is very rare in females. An infant with  the neonatal-onset form of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may be lacking  in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have a poorly-controlled  breathing rate or body temperature. Infants with this disorder may be described  as"floppy"and can experience  or coma. Complications from ornithine  transcarbamylase deficiency may include  . Progressive liver damage may also occur. html:p In some affected individuals, signs and symptoms of ornithine transcarbamylase  deficiency may be less severe, and may not appear until later in life. The  late-onset form of the disorder occurs in both males and females. People with  late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may experience episodes of  altered mental status, such as delirium, erratic behavior, or a reduced level of  consciousness. Headaches, vomiting, aversion to protein foods, and  can  also occur in this form of the disorder.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that primarily occurs in older</span>  adults. This condition is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage, the tough  but flexible tissue that covers the ends of the bones at the joints and allows  smooth joint movements. One or more parts of the body can be affected, most  often the hands, shoulders, spine, knees, or hips. html:p Osteoarthritis usually develops slowly, causing pain, stiffness, and restricted  movement as the condition gets worse. Areas of bone no longer cushioned by  cartilage rub against each other and start to break down. Further damage is  caused as the body attempts to repair and rebuild these tissues. The immune  system, which plays a role in healing injuries, targets these areas, and its  response leads to inflammation of the joint tissues. Abnormal growths of bone  (osteophytes) and other tissue can also occur, and may be visible as enlarged  joints. Enlargement of the joints of the fingers is especially noticeable. html:p People with osteoarthritis typically experience stiffness following periods of  inactivity such as upon awakening or rising from a chair; the stiffness usually  improves as they move around. In some affected individuals, the condition never  causes major problems. In others, severe osteoarthritis can impair mobility and  the ability to perform daily tasks, affecting quality of life and increasing the  risk of other health conditions such as cardiovascular disease. html:p Osteoarthritis is most common in middle age or late adulthood, because the  cartilage at the joints naturally begins to thin as people age. However, it can  occur earlier in life, especially after injuries affecting the joints such as a  type of knee injury called an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. People who  are overweight or whose activities are particularly stressful to the joints are  also at increased risk of developing osteoarthritis.

Description1: html:p Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect  the bones. The term"osteogenesis imperfecta"means imperfect bone formation.  People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma  or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases,  can occur even before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over  a person's lifetime. html:p There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, designated  type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and  symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. Type I is the mildest  form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type II is the most severe; other types of  this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two  extremes. Increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms  of osteogenesis imperfecta. html:p The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, including type I, are characterized  by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor  trauma. Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms  of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that  is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood.  Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. html:p Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone  fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma.  Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, ,  , respiratory problems, and a called  . The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta,  particularly type II, can include an  underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening  problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/osteoglophonic-dysplasia
frequency1: Osteoglophonic dysplasia is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. Only about 15 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Osteoglophonic dysplasia is a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth  that leads to severe head and face (craniofacial) abnormalities, dwarfism, and  other features. The term osteoglophonic refers to the bones (osteo-) having  distinctive hollowed out (-glophonic) areas that appear as holes on x-ray  images. html:p Premature fusion of certain bones in the skull (craniosynostosis) typically  occurs in osteoglophonic dysplasia. The craniosynostosis associated with this  disorder may give the head a tall appearance, often referred to in the medical  literature as a tower-shaped skull, or a relatively mild version of a deformity  called a cloverleaf skull. Characteristic facial features in people with  osteoglophonic dysplasia include a prominent forehead (frontal bossing), widely  spaced eyes (hypertelorism),  , a large tongue (macroglossia), a  protruding jaw (prognathism), and a short neck. People with this condition  usually have no visible teeth because the teeth never emerge from the jaw  (clinical anodontia). In addition, the gums are often overgrown (hypertrophic  gingiva). html:p Infants with osteoglophonic dysplasia often experience failure to thrive, which  means they do not gain weight and grow at the expected rate. Affected  individuals have short, bowed legs and arms and are . They also  have flat feet and short, broad hands and fingers. html:p The life expectancy of people with osteoglophonic dysplasia depends on the  extent of their craniofacial abnormalities; those that obstruct the air passages  and affect the mouth and teeth can lead to respiratory problems and cause  difficulty with eating and drinking. Despite the skull abnormalities,  intelligence is generally not affected in this disorder.

Description1: html:p Osteopetrosis is a bone disease that makes bones abnormally dense and prone to  breakage (fracture). Researchers have described several major types of  osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance:  autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. The different types of the  disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms. html:p Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO), which is also called Albers-Schönberg  disease, is typically the mildest type of the disorder. Some affected  individuals have no symptoms. In these people, the unusually dense bones may be  discovered by accident when an x-ray is done for another reason. In affected  individuals who develop signs and symptoms, the major features of the condition  include multiple bone fractures, abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine  (scoliosis) or other spinal abnormalities, arthritis in the hips, and a bone  infection called osteomyelitis. These problems usually become apparent in late  childhood or adolescence. html:p Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) is a more severe form of the disorder  that becomes apparent in early infancy. Affected individuals have a high risk of  bone fracture resulting from seemingly minor bumps and falls. Their abnormally  dense skull bones pinch nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves), often  resulting in vision loss, hearing loss, and paralysis of facial muscles. Dense  bones can also impair the function of bone marrow, preventing it from producing  new blood cells and immune system cells. As a result, people with severe  osteopetrosis are at risk of abnormal bleeding, a shortage of red blood cells  (anemia), and recurrent infections. In the most severe cases, these bone marrow  abnormalities can be life-threatening in infancy or early childhood. html:p Other features of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis can include and  , dental abnormalities, and an enlarged liver and spleen  (hepatosplenomegaly). Depending on the genetic changes involved, people with  severe osteopetrosis can also have brain abnormalities,  disability,  or recurrent  (). html:p A few individuals have been diagnosed with intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis  (IAO), a form of the disorder that can have either an autosomal dominant or an  autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The signs and symptoms of this  condition become noticeable in childhood and include an increased risk of bone  fracture and anemia. People with this form of the disorder typically do not have  life-threatening bone marrow abnormalities. However, some affected individuals  have had abnormal calcium deposits (calcifications) in the brain,  disability, and a form of kidney disease called renal tubular acidosis. html:p Rarely, osteopetrosis can have an X-linked pattern of inheritance. In addition  to abnormally dense bones, the X-linked form of the disorder is characterized by  abnormal swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema) and a condition  called anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia that affects the skin, hair, teeth, and  sweat glands. Affected individuals also have a malfunctioning immune system  (immunodeficiency), which allows severe, recurrent infections to develop.  Researchers often refer to this condition as OL-EDA-ID, an acronym derived from  each of the major features of the disorder.

Description1: html:p Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome is a rare condition characterized by severe  thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) and eye abnormalities that lead to vision  loss. In people with this condition, osteoporosis is usually recognized in early  childhood. It is caused by a shortage of minerals, such as calcium, in bones  (decreased bone mineral density), which makes the bones brittle and prone to  fracture. Affected individuals often have multiple bone fractures, including in  the bones that form the spine (vertebrae). Multiple fractures can cause collapse  of the affected vertebrae (compressed vertebrae), abnormal side-to-side  curvature of the spine (scoliosis), , and limb deformities.  Decreased bone mineral density can also cause softening or thinning of the skull  (craniotabes). html:p Most affected individuals have impaired vision at birth or by early infancy and  are blind by young adulthood. Vision problems are usually caused by one of  several eye conditions, grouped together as pseudoglioma, that affect the  light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), although other eye  conditions have been identified in affected individuals. Pseudogliomas are so  named because, on examination, the conditions resemble an eye tumor known as a  retinal glioma. html:p Rarely, people with osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome have additional signs or  symptoms such as mild  disability,  (),  abnormally flexible joints, or .

Description1: html:p Otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 is a disorder involving abnormalities in  and other health problems. It is a member of a group of  related conditions called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which also  includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 1, frontometaphyseal dysplasia, and  Melnick-Needles syndrome. In general, these disorders involve hearing loss  caused by malformations in the tiny bones in the ears (ossicles), problems in    . Otopalatodigital syndrome type 2  also tends to cause problems in other areas of the body, such as the brain and  heart. html:p People with otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 have characteristic facial features  including wide-set and downward-slanting eyes; prominent brow ridges; a broad,  flat nose; and a very small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia). The base of the  skull may be thickened. Some people with this disorder have hearing loss.  Affected individuals are usually of  and may have abnormalities of  the fingers and toes, such as unusual curvature of the fingers (camptodactyly)  and shortened or absent thumbs and big toes. They may have bowed limbs;  underdeveloped, irregular ribs that may cause problems with breathing; and other  abnormal or absent bones. Some may be born with an opening in the roof of the  mouth (a cleft palate). html:p In addition to skeletal abnormalities, individuals with otopalatodigital  syndrome type 2 may have , increased fluid in the center of  the brain (hydrocephalus), protrusion of the abdominal organs through the navel  (omphalocele), s, chest abnormalities, obstruction of the ducts  between the kidneys and bladder (ureters), and, in males,   html:p Males with otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 generally have much more severe  signs and symptoms than do females. Males with the disorder usually do not live  beyond their first year, because their underdeveloped rib cage does not allow  sufficient lung expansion for breathing.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/otospondylomegaepiphyseal-dysplasia
frequency1: This condition is rare; its prevalence is unknown. Only a few families with OSMED worldwide have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) is a condition characterized by  skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and severe hearing loss.  The term"otospondylomegaepiphyseal"refers to the parts of the body that this  condition affects: the ears (oto-), the bones of the spine (spondylo-), and the  ends (epiphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs. The features of this  condition significantly overlap those of two similar conditions,  Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome and Stickler syndrome type III. All of these  conditions are caused by mutations in the same gene, and in some cases, it can  be difficult to tell the conditions apart. Some researchers believe they  represent a single disorder with a range of signs and symptoms. html:p People with OSMED are often shorter than average because the long bones in their  legs are unusually short. Other skeletal features include enlarged joints;  short arms, hands, and fingers; and flattened bones of the spine  (platyspondyly). People with the disorder often experience back and joint pain,  limited joint movement, and arthritis that begins early in life. html:p Severe high-frequency hearing loss is common in people with OSMED. Typical  facial features include protruding eyes; a flattened bridge of the nose; an  upturned nose with a large, rounded tip; and a small lower jaw. Almost all  affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft  palate).

Description1: html:p Otulipenia is characterized by abnormal inflammation throughout the body.  Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders  (such as bacteria). However, the uncontrolled inflammation that occurs in  otulipenia can damage many of the body's tissues and organs, including the  gastrointestinal system, joints, and skin. Disorders such as otulipenia that  result from abnormally increased inflammation are known as autoinflammatory  diseases. html:p Signs and symptoms of otulipenia usually begin within the first few weeks of  life, with recurring episodes of fever; diarrhea; painful, swollen joints; and  skin rashes. The skin rashes are due to inflammation of the layer of fatty  tissue under the skin (panniculitis), which causes painful red bumps. Some  people with otulipenia have an abnormal distribution of fatty tissue in their  bodies (lipodystrophy). Affected infants have difficulty growing and gaining  weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Damage to the body's tissues  and organs caused by inflammation is life-threatening if the condition is not  treated.

GHR-webpage1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ovarian-cancer</span>
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Ovarian cancer is diagnosed in about 22,000 women in the United States each</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">year. A woman's lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is about 1 in 75.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Ovarian cancer is a disease that affects women. In this form of cancer, certain</span>  cells in the ovary become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor.  The ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced.  In about 90 percent of cases, ovarian cancer occurs after age 40, and most cases  occur after age 60. html:p The most common form of ovarian cancer begins in epithelial cells, which are the  cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. These cancers can arise  in the epithelial cells on the surface of the ovary. However, researchers  suggest that many or even most ovarian cancers begin in epithelial cells on the  fringes (fimbriae) at the end of one of the fallopian tubes, and the cancerous  cells migrate to the ovary. html:p Cancer can also begin in epithelial cells that form the lining of the abdomen  (the peritoneum). This form of cancer, called primary peritoneal cancer,  resembles epithelial ovarian cancer in its origin, symptoms, progression, and  treatment. Primary peritoneal cancer often spreads to the ovaries. It can also  occur even if the ovaries have been removed. Because cancers that begin in the  ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum are so similar and spread easily from  one of these structures to the others, they are often difficult to distinguish.  These cancers are so closely related that they are generally considered  collectively by experts. html:p In about 10 percent of cases, ovarian cancer develops not in epithelial cells  but in germ cells, which are precursors to egg cells, or in hormone-producing  ovarian cells called granulosa cells. html:p In its early stages, ovarian cancer usually does not cause noticeable symptoms.  As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include pain or a feeling of  heaviness in the pelvis or lower abdomen, bloating, feeling full quickly when  eating, back pain, vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods or after  menopause, or changes in urinary or bowel habits. However, these changes can  occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms  does not mean that a woman has ovarian cancer. html:p In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to  other parts of the body. If ovarian cancer spreads, cancerous tumors most often  appear in the abdominal cavity or on the surfaces of nearby organs such as the  bladder or colon. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas  of the body are called metastatic cancers. html:p Some ovarian cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as  hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary ovarian  cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases. html:p Because it is often diagnosed at a late stage, ovarian cancer can be difficult  to treat; it leads to the deaths of about 14,000 women annually in the United  States, more than any other gynecological cancer. However, when it is diagnosed  and treated early, the 5-year survival rate is high.

frequency1: Although the prevalence of pachyonychia congenita is unknown, it appears to be rare. There are probably several thousand people worldwide with this disorder.
Description1: html:p Pachyonychia congenita is a condition that primarily affects the nails and skin.  The signs and symptoms of this condition usually become apparent within the  first few months of life. html:p Almost everyone with pachyonychia congenita has hypertrophic nail dystrophy,  which causes the fingernails and toenails to become thick and abnormally shaped.  Many affected children also develop very painful blisters and calluses on the  soles of the feet and, less commonly, on the palms of the hands. This condition  is known as palmoplantar keratoderma. Severe blisters and calluses on the feet  can make it painful or impossible to walk. html:p Pachyonychia congenita can have several additional features, which vary among  affected individuals. These features include thick, white patches on the tongue  and inside of the cheeks (oral leukokeratosis); bumps called follicular  keratoses that develop around hair follicles on the elbows, knees, and  waistline; cysts in the armpits, groin, back, or scalp; and excessive sweating  on the palms and soles (palmoplantar hyperhidrosis). Some affected individuals  also develop widespread cysts called steatocystomas, which are filled with an  oily substance called sebum that normally lubricates the skin and hair. Some  babies with pachyonychia congenita have prenatal or natal teeth, which are teeth  that are present at birth or in early infancy. Rarely, pachyonychia congenita  can affect the voice box (larynx), potentially leading to hoarseness or  breathing problems. html:p Researchers used to split pachyonychia congenita into two types, PC-1 and PC-2,  based on the genetic cause and pattern of signs and symptoms. However, as more  affected individuals were identified, it became clear that the features of the  two types overlapped considerably. Now researchers prefer to describe  pachyonychia congenita based on the gene that is altered.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Paget disease of bone is a disorder that causes bones to grow larger and weaker</span>  than normal. Affected bones may be misshapen and easily broken (fractured). html:p The classic form of Paget disease of bone typically appears in middle age or  later. It usually occurs in one or a few bones and does not spread from one bone  to another. Any bones can be affected, although the disease most commonly  affects bones in the spine, pelvis, skull, or legs. html:p Many people with classic Paget disease of bone do not experience any symptoms  associated with their bone abnormalities. The disease is often diagnosed  unexpectedly by x-rays or laboratory tests done for other reasons. People who  develop symptoms are most likely to experience pain. The affected bones may  themselves be painful, or pain may be caused by arthritis in nearby joints.  Arthritis results when the distortion of bones, particularly weight-bearing  bones in the legs, causes extra wear and tear on the joints. Arthritis most  frequently affects the knees and hips in people with this disease. html:p Other complications of Paget disease of bone depend on which bones are affected.  If the disease occurs in bones of the skull, it can cause an enlarged head,  hearing loss, headaches, and dizziness. If the disease affects bones in the  spine, it can lead to numbness and tingling (due to pinched nerves) and abnormal  spinal curvature. In the leg bones, the disease can cause bowed legs and  difficulty walking. html:p A rare type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma has been associated with Paget  disease of bone. This type of cancer probably occurs in less than 1 in 1,000  people with this disease. html:p Early-onset Paget disease of bone is a less common form of the disease that  appears in a person's teens or twenties. Its features are similar to those of  the classic form of the disease, although it is more likely to affect the skull,  spine, and ribs (the axial skeleton) and the small bones of the hands. The  early-onset form of the disorder is also associated with hearing loss early in  life.

These areas may fill in as affected  children get older. Many affected individuals also have streaks or patches of  skin that are darker or lighter than the surrounding skin. These skin changes  can occur anywhere on the body, and they may be apparent at birth or occur later  in life. html:p Additional features of Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome can include hearing  loss, vision impairment, , extra nipples, , and  s. Affected individuals may also have skeletal abnormalities such as  extra fingers and/or toes, large big toes (halluces), and unusually short arms  and legs. About 40 percent of affected infants are born with a congenital  diaphragmatic hernia, which is a hole in the muscle that separates the abdomen  from the chest cavity (the diaphragm). This potentially serious birth defect  allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest, where they can crowd  the developing heart and lungs. html:p The signs and symptoms of Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome vary, although most  people with this disorder have severe to profound  disability and  other serious health problems. The most severe cases involve birth defects that  are life-threatening in early infancy. However, several affected people have had  milder features, including mild  disability and less noticeable  physical abnormalities.

Description1: html:p Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (formerly called  Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome) is a disorder of the nervous system. This  condition is characterized by progressive difficulty with movement, typically  beginning in childhood. Movement abnormalities include involuntary muscle  spasms, rigidity, and trouble with walking that worsens over time. Many people  with this condition also develop problems with  (), and some  develop vision loss. Additionally, affected individuals may experience a loss  of  function (dementia) and  symptoms such as  problems, personality changes, and . html:p Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration is characterized by an abnormal  buildup of iron in certain areas of the brain. A particular change called the  eye-of-the-tiger sign, which indicates an accumulation of iron, is typically  seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain in people with this  disorder. html:p Researchers have described classic and atypical forms of pantothenate  kinase-associated neurodegeneration. The classic form usually appears in early  childhood, causing severe problems with movement that worsen rapidly. Features  of the atypical form appear later in childhood or adolescence and progress more  slowly. Signs and symptoms vary, but the atypical form is more likely than the  classic form to involve  defects and  problems. html:p A condition called HARP (hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis  pigmentosa, and pallidal degeneration), which was historically described as a  separate syndrome, is now considered part of pantothenate kinase-associated  neurodegeneration. Although HARP is much rarer than classic pantothenate  kinase-associated neurodegeneration, both conditions involve problems with  movement, dementia, and vision abnormalities.

frequency1: Paramyotonia congenita is an uncommon disorder; it is estimated to affect fewer than 1 in 100,000 people.
Description1: html:p Paramyotonia congenita is a disorder that affects muscles used for movement  (skeletal muscles). Beginning in infancy or early childhood, people with this  condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent  muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness that typically  appears after exercise and can be induced by muscle cooling. This stiffness  chiefly affects muscles in the face, neck, arms, and hands, although it can also  affect muscles used for breathing and muscles in the lower body. Unlike many  other forms of myotonia, the muscle stiffness associated with paramyotonia  congenita tends to worsen with repeated movements. html:p Most people—even those without muscle disease—feel that their muscles do not  work as well when they are cold. This effect is dramatic in people with  paramyotonia congenita. Exposure to cold initially causes muscle stiffness in  these individuals, and prolonged cold exposure leads to temporary episodes of  mild to severe muscle weakness that may last for several hours at a time. Some  older people with paramyotonia congenita develop permanent muscle weakness that  can be disabling.

frequency1: Parathyroid cancer is one of the rarest types of cancer. It accounts for 0.005 percent of all cancers, with about 1,000 cases reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Parathyroid cancer is a rare cancer that usually affects people in their forties  or fifties and occurs in one of the four parathyroid glands. The parathyroid  glands are located in the neck and secrete parathyroid hormone, which enhances  the release of calcium into the blood. html:p In about 90 percent of cases, the early signs of parathyroid cancer are high  levels of parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism) and calcium (hypercalcemia)  in the blood. In these cases, the cancer is described as hormonally functional  because the parathyroid glands are producing excess hormone. html:p Many individuals with hormonally functional parathyroid cancer develop  hypercalcemic crisis, in which calcium levels in the blood are very high.  Neurological problems can develop, including changes in mood and .  About 30 percent of individuals with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid cancer  develop kidney and skeletal problems. These problems include increased urine  production (polyuria), deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis)  leading to the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), bone pain, bone  loss, and increased bone fractures. Abdominal pain, inflammation of the pancreas  (pancreatitis), sores (ulcers) in the lining of the digestive tract, nausea,  vomiting, weight loss, and fatigue are also common. html:p About 10 percent of cases of parathyroid cancer are described as hormonally  nonfunctional. In these cases, levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium are  normal. The signs and symptoms of hormonally nonfunctional parathyroid cancer  are related to the tumor obstructing nearby structures in the neck. These  problems include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and speaking (), a  hoarse voice, shortness of breath (dyspnea), or vocal cord paralysis. html:p Up to 85 percent of individuals with parathyroid survive at least 5 years after  they are diagnosed. The disease recurs in approximately half of individuals. If  cancer does recur, it will commonly be within 3 years of the original diagnosis  and up to 78 percent of people with recurrent cancer survive at least 5 years.  Hormonally nonfunctional parathyroid cancer has a lower survival rate because it  is often found at a later stage, as it does not have early signs such as  increased calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. html:p In hormonally functional parathyroid cancer, death is usually caused by organ  failure (usually kidney failure) due to prolonged hypercalcemia and not directly  due to the tumor. In hormonally nonfunctional parathyroid cancer, the cause of  death is typically related to the tumor itself, such as its impact on the  function of nearby structures or its spread to other tissues (metastasis).

frequency1: Parkes Weber syndrome is a rare condition; its exact prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Parkes Weber syndrome is a disorder of the vascular system, which is the body's  complex network of blood vessels. The vascular system consists of arteries,  which carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body's various organs and  tissues; veins, which carry blood back to the heart; and capillaries, which are  tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. html:p Parkes Weber syndrome is characterized by vascular abnormalities known as  capillary malformations and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), which are present  from birth. The capillary malformations increase blood flow near the surface of  the skin. They usually look like large, flat, pink stains on the skin, and  because of their color are sometimes called"port-wine stains."In people with  Parkes Weber syndrome, capillary malformations occur together with multiple  micro-AVFs, which are tiny abnormal connections between arteries and veins that  affect blood circulation. These AVFs can be associated with life-threatening  complications including abnormal bleeding and heart failure. html:p Another characteristic feature of Parkes Weber syndrome is overgrowth of one  limb, most commonly a leg. Abnormal growth occurs in bones and soft tissues,  making one of the limbs longer and larger around than the corresponding one. html:p Some vascular abnormalities seen in Parkes Weber syndrome are similar to those  that occur in a condition called capillary malformation-arteriovenous  malformation syndrome (CM-AVM). CM-AVM and some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome  have the same genetic cause.

Description1: html:p Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is a condition characterized by skin redness  and warmth (flushing) and attacks of severe pain in various parts of the body.  The area of flushing typically corresponds to the site of the pain. The pain  attacks experienced by people with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder usually last  seconds to minutes, but in some cases can last hours. These attacks can start  as early as infancy. Early in life, the pain is typically concentrated in the  lower part of the body, especially around the rectum, and is usually triggered  by a bowel movement. Some children may develop constipation, which is thought to  be due to fear of triggering a pain attack. Pain attacks in these young  children may also be accompanied by , slow heartbeat, or short pauses in  breathing (apnea). html:p As a person with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder ages, the location of pain  changes. Pain attacks switch from affecting the lower body to affecting the head  and face, especially the eyes and jaw. Triggers of these pain attacks include  changes in temperature (such as a cold wind) and emotional distress as well as  eating spicy foods and drinking cold drinks. html:p Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy  because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and  spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell,  and pain.

The disorder affects red  blood cells (erythrocytes), which carry oxygen; white blood cells (leukocytes),  which protect the body from infection; and platelets (thrombocytes), which are  involved in blood clotting. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria affects both  sexes equally, and can occur at any age, although it is most often diagnosed in  young adulthood. html:p People with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria have sudden, recurring episodes  of symptoms (paroxysmal symptoms), which may be triggered by stresses on the  body, such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood  cells are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis). Affected individuals may pass  dark-colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying  protein in blood. The abnormal presence of hemoglobin in the urine is called  hemoglobinuria. In many, but not all cases, hemoglobinuria is most noticeable in  the morning, upon passing urine that has accumulated in the bladder during the  night (nocturnal). html:p The premature destruction of red blood cells results in a deficiency of these  cells in the blood (hemolytic anemia), which can cause signs and symptoms such  as fatigue, weakness, abnormally pale skin (pallor), shortness of breath, and an  increased heart rate. People with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria may also  be prone to infections due to a deficiency of white blood cells. html:p Abnormal platelets associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria can cause  problems in the blood clotting process. As a result, people with this disorder  may experience abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis), especially in large  abdominal veins; or, less often, episodes of severe bleeding (hemorrhage). html:p Individuals with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are at increased risk of  developing cancer in blood-forming cells (leukemia). html:p In some cases, people who have been treated for another blood disease called  aplastic anemia may develop paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

frequency1: Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is a severe disorder that usually begins in  infancy. It causes  (hematopoietic) cells in the bone marrow that have the potential to develop into  different types of blood cells. For this reason, Pearson marrow-pancreas  syndrome is considered a bone marrow failure disorder. Function of the pancreas  and other organs can also be affected. html:p Most affected individuals have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can  cause pale skin (pallor), weakness, and fatigue. Some of these individuals also  have low numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia) and platelets  (thrombocytopenia). Neutropenia can lead to frequent infections;  thrombocytopenia sometimes causes easy bruising and bleeding. When visualized  under the microscope, bone marrow cells from affected individuals may appear  abnormal. Often, early blood cells (hematopoietic precursors) have multiple  fluid-filled pockets called vacuoles. In addition, red blood cells in the bone  marrow can have an abnormal buildup of iron that appears as a ring of blue  staining in the cell after treatment with certain dyes. These abnormal cells are  called ring sideroblasts. html:p In people with Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome, the pancreas does not work as  well as usual. The pancreas produces and releases enzymes that aid in the  digestion of fats and proteins. Reduced function of this organ can lead to high  levels of fats in the liver (liver steatosis). The pancreas also releases  insulin, which helps maintain correct blood sugar levels. A small number of  individuals with Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome develop diabetes, a condition  characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels that can be caused by a  shortage of insulin. In addition, affected individuals may have scarring  (fibrosis) in the pancreas. html:p People with Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome have a reduced ability to absorb  nutrients from the diet (malabsorption), and most affected infants have an  inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive).  Another common occurrence in people with this condition is buildup in the body  of a chemical called lactic acid (lactic acidosis), which can be  life-threatening. In addition, liver and kidney problems can develop in people  with this condition. html:p About half of children with this severe disorder die in infancy or early  childhood due to severe lactic acidosis or liver failure. Many of those who  survive develop signs and symptoms later in life of a related disorder called  Kearns-Sayre syndrome. This condition causes weakness of muscles around the eyes  and other problems.

Description1: html:p Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is an inherited condition involving the brain and  spinal cord (central nervous system). This disease is one of a group of genetic  disorders called leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies are characterized by  degeneration of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes  the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is  caused by an inability to form myelin (dysmyelination).

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">The prevalence of Pendred syndrome is unknown. However, researchers</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">estimate that it accounts for 7 to 8 percent of all hearing loss that is present</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">from birth (congenital hearing loss).</span>
Description1: html:p Pendred syndrome is a disorder typically associated with hearing loss and a  thyroid condition called a goiter. A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid  gland, which is a butterfly-shaped organ at the base of the neck that produces  hormones. If a goiter develops in a person with Pendred syndrome, it usually  forms between late childhood and early adulthood. In most cases, this  enlargement does not cause the thyroid to malfunction. html:p In most people with Pendred syndrome, severe to profound hearing loss caused by  changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) is evident at birth. Less  commonly, hearing loss does not develop until later in infancy or early  childhood. Some affected individuals also have problems with balance caused by  dysfunction of the vestibular system, which is the part of the inner ear that  helps maintain the body's balance and orientation. html:p An inner ear abnormality called an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is a  characteristic feature of Pendred syndrome. The vestibular aqueduct is a bony  canal that connects the inner ear with the inside of the skull. Some affected  individuals also have an abnormally shaped cochlea, which is a snail-shaped  structure in the inner ear that helps process sound. The combination of an  enlarged vestibular aqueduct and an abnormally shaped cochlea is known as  Mondini malformation. html:p Pendred syndrome shares features with other hearing loss and thyroid conditions,  and it is unclear whether they are best considered as separate disorders or as  a spectrum of related signs and symptoms. These conditions include a form of  nonsyndromic hearing loss (hearing loss that does not affect other parts of the  body) called DFNB4, and, in a small number of people, a form of congenital  hypothyroidism resulting from an  . All of these conditions are caused by mutations in the same gene.

frequency1: Periventricular heterotopia is a rare condition. Its incidence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Periventricular heterotopia is a condition in which nerve cells (neurons) do not  migrate properly during the early development of the fetal brain, from about  the 6th week to the 24th week of pregnancy. Heterotopia means"out of place."In  normal brain development, neurons form in the periventricular region, located  around fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain. The  neurons then migrate outward to form the exterior of the brain (cerebral cortex)  in six onion-like layers. In periventricular heterotopia, some neurons fail to  migrate to their proper position and form clumps around the ventricles. html:p Periventricular heterotopia usually becomes evident when  first appear,  often during the teenage years. The nodules around the ventricles are then  typically discovered when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are done.  Affected individuals usually have normal intelligence, although some have mild  disability. Difficulty with reading and spelling (dyslexia) has  been reported in some people with periventricular heterotopia. html:p Less commonly, individuals with periventricular heterotopia may have more severe  brain malformations, small head size (microcephaly),  recurrent infections, blood vessel abnormalities, or other problems.  Periventricular heterotopia may also occur in association with other conditions  such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which results in extremely flexible joints, skin  that stretches easily, and fragile blood vessels.

Description1: html:p Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome is a disorder of sexual development that  affects males. Males with this disorder have normal male reproductive organs,  though they also have a uterus and fallopian tubes, which are female  reproductive organs. The uterus and fallopian tubes are derived from a structure  called the Müllerian duct during development of the fetus. The Müllerian duct  usually breaks down during early development in males, but it is retained in  those with persistent Müllerian duct syndrome. Affected individuals have the  normal chromosomes of a male (46,XY) and normal external male genitalia. html:p The first noted signs and symptoms in males with persistent Müllerian duct  syndrome are usually undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or soft out-pouchings  in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernias). The uterus and fallopian tubes are  typically discovered when surgery is performed to treat these conditions. html:p The testes and female reproductive organs can be located in unusual positions in  persistent Müllerian duct syndrome. Occasionally, both testes are undescended  (bilateral cryptorchidism) and the uterus is in the pelvis. More often, one  testis has descended into the scrotum normally, and one has not. Sometimes, the  descended testis pulls the fallopian tube and uterus into the track through  which it has descended. This creates a condition called hernia uteri inguinalis,  a form of inguinal hernia. In other cases, the undescended testis from the  other side of the body is also pulled into the same track, forming an inguinal  hernia. This condition, called transverse testicular ectopia, is common in  people with persistent Müllerian duct syndrome. html:p Other effects of persistent Müllerian duct syndrome may include the inability to  father children (infertility) or blood in the semen (hematospermia). Also, the  undescended testes may break down (degenerate) or develop cancer if left  untreated.

Description1: html:p Peters anomaly is characterized by eye problems that occur in an area at the  front part of the eye known as the anterior segment. The anterior segment  consists of structures including the lens, the colored part (iris) of the eye,  and the clear covering of the eye (cornea). During development of the eye, the  elements of the anterior segment form separate structures. However, in Peters  anomaly, development of the anterior segment is abnormal, leading to incomplete  separation of the cornea from the iris or the lens. As a result, the cornea is  cloudy (opaque), which causes blurred vision. The opaque area (opacity) of the  cornea varies in size and intensity from a small, faint streak to a large, white  cloudy area that covers the front surface of the eye. Additionally, the  location of the opacity varies; the cloudiness may be at the center of the  cornea or off-center. Large, centrally located opacities tend to cause poorer  vision than smaller, off-center ones. html:p Nearly half of the individuals affected with Peters anomaly have low vision  early in life and about a quarter are legally blind. Due to a lack of visual  stimulation, some individuals develop"lazy eye"(amblyopia). Peters anomaly is  often associated with other eye problems, such as increased pressure within the  eye (glaucoma), clouding of the lens (cataract), and unusually small eyeballs  (microphthalmia). In most cases, Peters anomaly is bilateral, which means that  it affects both eyes, although the level of vision impairment may be different  in each eye. These individuals may have eyes that do not point in the same  direction (strabismus). In some people with Peters anomaly, corneal clouding  improves over time leading to improved vision. html:p There are two types of Peters anomaly, which are distinguished by their signs  and symptoms. Peters anomaly type I is characterized by an incomplete separation  of the cornea and iris and mild to moderate corneal opacity. Type II is  characterized by an incomplete separation of the cornea and lens and severe  corneal opacity that may involve the entire cornea.

Description1: html:p Peters plus syndrome is an inherited condition that is characterized by eye  abnormalities, , an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without  an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), distinctive facial features,  and  disability. html:p The eye problems in Peters plus syndrome occur in an area at the front part of  the eye known as the anterior segment. The anterior segment consists of  structures including the lens, the colored part of the eye (iris), and the clear  covering of the eye (cornea). An eye problem called Peters anomaly is the most  common anterior segment abnormality seen in Peters plus syndrome. Peters anomaly  involves abnormal development of the anterior segment, which results in a  . Peters anomaly may  also be associated with clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts) or other  lens abnormalities. Peters anomaly is usually bilateral, which means that it  affects both eyes. The severity of corneal clouding and other eye problems can  vary between individuals with Peters plus syndrome, even among members of the  same family. Many people with Peters plus syndrome experience vision loss that  worsens over time. html:p All people with Peters plus syndrome have , which is evident before  birth. The height of adult males with this condition ranges from 141  centimeters to 155 centimeters (4 feet, 7 inches to 5 feet, 1 inch), and the  height of adult females ranges from 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet,  2 inches to 4 feet, 11 inches). Individuals with Peters plus syndrome also have  shortened upper limbs (rhizomelia) and shortened fingers and toes  (brachydactyly). html:p The characteristic facial features of Peters plus syndrome include a prominent  forehead; small, malformed ears; narrow eyes; a long area between the nose and  mouth (philtrum); and a pronounced double curve of the upper lip (Cupid's bow).  The neck may also be broad and webbed. A cleft lip with or without a cleft  palate is present in about half of the people with this condition. html:p   children with Peters plus syndrome. Most affected individuals also have  disability that can range from mild to severe, although some have  normal intelligence. The severity of physical features does not predict the  level of  disability. html:p Less common signs and symptoms of Peters plus syndrome include s,  structural brain abnormalities, hearing loss, and kidney or genital  abnormalities.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pfeiffer-syndrome
frequency1: Pfeiffer syndrome affects about 1 in 100,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Pfeiffer syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of  certain skull bones (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull  from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. Pfeiffer  syndrome also affects bones in the hands and feet. html:p Many of the characteristic facial features of Pfeiffer syndrome result from  premature fusion of the skull bones. Abnormal growth of these bones leads to  bulging and wide-set eyes, a high forehead, an underdeveloped upper jaw, and a  beaked nose. More than half of all children with Pfeiffer syndrome have hearing  loss; dental problems are also common. html:p In people with Pfeiffer syndrome, the thumbs and first (big) toes are wide and  bend away from the other digits. Unusually short fingers and toes  (brachydactyly) are also common, and there may be some webbing or fusion between  the digits (syndactyly). html:p Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three subtypes. Type 1, also known as classic  Pfeiffer syndrome, has symptoms as described above. Most individuals with type 1  Pfeiffer syndrome have normal intelligence and a normal life span. Types 2 and  3 are more severe forms of Pfeiffer syndrome that often involve problems with  the nervous system. The premature fusion of skull bones can limit brain growth,  leading to and other neurological problems. In addition,  individuals with type 2 or 3 can have fusion of the bones (ankylosis) in the  elbow or other joints, limiting mobility, and abnormalities of the face and  airways, which can cause life-threatening breathing problems. Type 2 is  distinguished from type 3 by the presence of a cloverleaf-shaped head, which is  caused by more extensive fusion of bones in the skull.

Description1: html:p Phenylketonuria (commonly known as PKU) is an inherited disorder that increases  the levels of a substance called phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylalanine is a  building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the diet.  It is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. If PKU is not  treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing  disability and other serious health problems. html:p The signs and symptoms of PKU vary from mild to severe. The most severe form of  this disorder is known as classic PKU. Infants with classic PKU appear normal  until they are a few months old. Without treatment, these children develop  permanent  problems, and  disorders are also common. Untreated individuals may  have a musty or mouse-like odor as a side effect of excess phenylalanine in the  body. Children with classic PKU tend to have lighter skin and hair than  unaffected family members and are also likely to have skin disorders such as  eczema. html:p Less severe forms of this condition, sometimes called variant PKU and non-PKU  hyperphenylalaninemia, have a smaller risk of brain damage. People with very  mild cases may not require treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet. html:p Babies born to mothers who have PKU and uncontrolled phenylalanine levels (women  who no longer follow a low-phenylalanine diet) have a significant risk of  disability because they are exposed to very high levels of  phenylalanine before birth. These infants may also have a low birth weight and  grow more slowly than other children. Other characteristic medical problems  include s or other heart problems, an abnormally small head size  (microcephaly), and  problems. Women with PKU and uncontrolled  phenylalanine levels also have an increased risk of pregnancy loss.

Description1: html:p Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency is a condition characterized by an  ; impaired development of physical  reactions, movements, and; and recurrent  (). Different types of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase  deficiency have been described; they are distinguished by their severity and the  age at which symptoms first begin. Most affected individuals have the infantile  form, which is the most severe form, and are affected from infancy. Symptoms of  the juvenile and adult types appear later in life; these types are very rare. html:p In phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency there is a progressive loss of  brain cells leading to a loss of brain tissue (brain atrophy), specifically  affecting the fatty tissue known as myelin that surrounds nerve cells  (hypomyelination). Frequently, the tissue that connects the two halves of the  brain (corpus callosum) is small and thin, and the fluid-filled cavities  (ventricles) near the center of the brain are enlarged. Because development of  the brain is disrupted, the head does not grow at the same rate as the body, so  it appears that the head is getting smaller as the body grows (progressive  ). Poor brain growth leads to an inability to achieve many  developmental milestones such as sitting unsupported and speaking. Many affected  infants also have difficulty feeding. html:p The  in phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency can vary in type.  Recurrent muscle contractions called infantile spasms are typical early in the  disorder. Without early treatment,  may progress to tonic-clonic  , which involve a loss of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and  convulsions; myoclonic , which involve rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks;  or drop attacks, which are sudden episodes of . html:p Individuals with the infantile form of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency  develop many of the features described above.

Description1: html:p Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the body's  ability to break down the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary energy  source for most cells. Researchers have described two major forms of the  condition. The most common form is sometimes called the hemolytic form. It is  characterized by a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red  blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. Chronic hemolytic  anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin  (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. Some people  with the hemolytic form also have symptoms related to abnormal brain function,  including  disability, , and stroke. html:p The other form of phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is often called the  myopathic form. It primarily affects muscles, causing progressive weakness,  pain, and cramping, particularly with exercise. During exercise, muscle tissue  can be broken down, releasing a protein called myoglobin. This protein is  processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). If  untreated, myoglobinuria can lead to kidney failure. html:p Most people with phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency have either the hemolytic  form or the myopathic form. However, other combinations of signs and symptoms  (such as muscle weakness with neurologic symptoms) have also been reported.

Description1: html:p Pilomatricoma, also known as pilomatrixoma, is a type of noncancerous (benign)  skin tumor associated with hair follicles. Hair follicles are specialized  structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. Pilomatricomas occur most often  on the head or neck, although they can also be found on the arms, torso, or  legs. A pilomatricoma feels like a small, hard lump under the skin. This type of  tumor grows relatively slowly and usually does not cause pain or other  symptoms. Most affected individuals have a single tumor, although rarely  multiple pilomatricomas can occur. If a pilomatricoma is removed surgically, it  tends not to grow back (recur). html:p Most pilomatricomas occur in people under the age of 20. However, these tumors  can also appear later in life. Almost all pilomatricomas are benign, but a very  small percentage are cancerous (malignant). Unlike the benign form, the  malignant version of this tumor (known as a pilomatrix carcinoma) occurs most  often in middle age or late in life. html:p Pilomatricoma usually occurs without other signs or symptoms (isolated), but  this type of tumor has also rarely been reported with inherited conditions.  Disorders that can be associated with pilomatricoma include Gardner syndrome,  which is characterized by multiple growths (polyps) and cancers of the colon and  rectum; myotonic dystrophy, which is a form of muscular dystrophy; and  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is a condition that affects many parts of the  body and is associated with an increased risk of both benign and malignant  tumors.

These episodes can cause a lack of oxygen in  the blood, leading to a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). In  some cases, the lack of oxygen can cause loss of consciousness. Some older  individuals with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome develop widened and rounded tips of the  fingers and toes (clubbing) because of recurrent episodes of decreased oxygen in  the blood. The breathing problems occur only when the person is awake and  typically first appear in mid-childhood, but they can begin as early as infancy.  Episodes of hyperventilation and apnea can be triggered by emotions such as  excitement or  or by extreme tiredness (fatigue). html:p occurs in most people with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and usually begins  during childhood, although it can be present from birth. html:p Individuals with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome have distinctive facial features that  include thin eyebrows, sunken eyes, a prominent nose with a high nasal bridge, a  pronounced double curve of the upper lip (Cupid's bow), a wide mouth with full  lips, and widely spaced teeth. The ears are usually thick and cup-shaped. html:p Children with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor  with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. However, they can  also experience  and  problems. html:p Other features of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome may include constipation and other  gastrointestinal problems, an unusually small head (microcephaly),  nearsightedness (myopia), eyes that do not look in the same direction  (strabismus), , and minor brain abnormalities. Affected individuals  may also have small hands and feet, a single crease across the palms of the  hands, flat feet (pes planus), or unusually fleshy pads at the tips of the  fingers and toes. Males with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome may have undescended testes  (cryptorchidism).

frequency1: Pol III-related leukodystrophy is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. More than 100 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Pol III-related leukodystrophy is a disorder that affects the nervous system and  other parts of the body. Leukodystrophies are conditions that involve  abnormalities of the nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve  fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve fibers  and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. html:p Pol III-related leukodystrophy is a hypomyelinating disease, which means that  the nervous system of affected individuals has a reduced ability to form myelin.  Hypomyelination underlies most of the neurological problems associated with Pol  III-related leukodystrophy. A small number of people with this disorder also  have a loss of nerve cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating  movements (cerebellar atrophy) and  . These  brain abnormalities likely contribute to the neurological problems in affected  individuals. html:p People with Pol III-related leukodystrophy usually have  disability  ranging from mild to severe, which gradually worsens over time. Some affected  individuals have normal intelligence in early childhood but develop mild  disability during the course of the disease. html:p Difficulty s , which begins in childhood and slowly  worsens over time, is a characteristic feature of Pol III-related  leukodystrophy. Affected children typically have  . Their gait is unstable, and they usually walk with their  feet wide apart for balance. Affected individuals may eventually need to use a  walker or wheelchair.  () of the arms and  hands may occur in this disorder. In some cases the  occurs mainly during  movement (); other affected individuals experience the  both during movement and at rest. html:p Development of the teeth (dentition) is often abnormal in Pol III-related  leukodystrophy, resulting in the absence of some teeth (known as hypodontia or  oligodontia). Some affected infants are born with a few teeth (natal teeth),  which fall out during the first weeks of life. The primary (deciduous) teeth  appear later than usual, beginning at about age 2. In Pol III-related  leukodystrophy, the teeth may not appear in the usual sequence, in which front  teeth (incisors) appear before back teeth (molars). Instead, molars often appear  first, with incisors appearing later or not at all. Permanent teeth are also  delayed, and may not appear until adolescence. The teeth may also be unusually  shaped. html:p Some individuals with Pol III-related leukodystrophy have excessive salivation  and difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia), which can lead to choking.  They may also have  impairment (). People with Pol III-related  leukodystrophy often have abnormalities in eye movement, such as progressive  vertical gaze palsy, which is restricted up-and-down eye movement that worsens  over time. Nearsightedness is common in affected individuals, and clouding of  the lens of the eyes (cataracts) has also been reported. Deterioration (atrophy)  of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (the optic  nerves) and  may also occur in this disorder. html:p , which is a condition caused by  , may occur in Pol III-related  leukodystrophy. Affected individuals have delayed development of the typical  signs of puberty, such as the growth of body hair. html:p People with Pol III-related leukodystrophy may have different combinations of  its signs and symptoms. These varied combinations of clinical features were  originally described as separate disorders. Affected individuals may be  diagnosed with ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH);  hypomyelination, hypodontia,  (4H syndrome);  -ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH); leukodystrophy with  oligodontia (LO); or hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and  . Because these disorders were later found to have  the same genetic cause, researchers now group them as variations of the single  condition Pol III-related leukodystrophy.

Name1: Poland syndrome
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/poland-syndrome
frequency1: Poland syndrome has been estimated to occur in 1 in 20,000 newborns. For unknown reasons, this disorder occurs more than twice as often in males than in females. Poland syndrome may be underdiagnosed because mild cases without hand involvement may never come to medical attention.
Description1: html:p Poland syndrome is a disorder in which affected individuals are born with  missing or underdeveloped muscles on one side of the body, resulting in  abnormalities that can affect the chest, shoulder, arm, and hand. The extent and  severity of the abnormalities vary among affected individuals. html:p People with Poland syndrome are typically missing part of one of the major chest  muscles, called the pectoralis major. In most affected individuals, the missing  part is the large section of the muscle that normally runs from the upper arm  to the breastbone (sternum). The abnormal pectoralis major muscle may cause the  chest to appear concave. In some cases, additional muscles on the affected side  of the torso, including muscles in the chest wall, side, and shoulder, may be  missing or underdeveloped. There may also be rib cage abnormalities, such as  shortened ribs, and the ribs may be noticeable due to less fat under the skin  (subcutaneous fat). Breast and nipple abnormalities may also occur, and underarm  (axillary) hair is sometimes sparse or abnormally placed. In most cases, the  abnormalities in the chest area do not cause health problems or affect movement. html:p Many people with Poland syndrome have hand abnormalities on the affected side,  commonly including an underdeveloped hand with abnormally short fingers  (brachydactyly); small, underdeveloped (vestigial) fingers; and some fingers  that are fused together (syndactyly). This combination of hand abnormalities is  called symbrachydactyly. Some affected individuals have only one or two of  these features, or have a mild hand abnormality that is hardly noticeable; more  severe abnormalities can cause problems with use of the hand. The bones of the  forearm (radius and ulna) are shortened in some people with Poland syndrome, but  this shortening may also be difficult to detect unless measured. html:p Mild cases of Poland syndrome without hand involvement may not be evident until  puberty, when the differences (asymmetry) between the two sides of the chest  become more apparent. By contrast, severely affected individuals have  abnormalities of the chest, hand, or both that are apparent at birth. In rare  cases, severely affected individuals have abnormalities of internal organs such  as a lung or a kidney, or the heart is abnormally located in the right side of  the chest (dextrocardia). html:p Rarely, chest and hand abnormalities resembling those of Poland syndrome occur  on both sides of the body, but researchers disagree as to whether this condition  is a variant of Poland syndrome or a different disorder.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other</span>  organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and  interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth  of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure.  Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver. html:p Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high  blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine  (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve  abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an  increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel  called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be  life-threatening if they tear or rupture. html:p The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual  age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The  autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that  typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present  from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be  further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The  autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD)  is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this  condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.

This condition has also been diagnosed in more than 100 people in the Japanese population. Although affected individuals have been reported worldwide, PLOSL appears to be less common in other countries.
Description1: html:p Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy,  commonly known as PLOSL, is a progressive disorder that affects the bones and  brain."Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia"refers to cyst-like bone  changes that can be seen on x-rays."Sclerosing leukoencephalopathy"describes  specific changes in the brain that are found in people with this disorder. html:p The bone abnormalities associated with PLOSL usually become apparent in a  person's twenties. In most affected individuals, pain and tenderness in the  ankles and feet are the first symptoms of the disease. Several years later,  broken bones (fractures) begin to occur frequently, particularly in bones of the  ankles, feet, wrists, and hands. Bone pain and fractures are caused by  thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) and cyst-like changes. These abnormalities  weaken bones and make them more likely to break. html:p The brain abnormalities characteristic of PLOSL typically appear in a person's  thirties. Personality changes are among the first noticeable problems, followed  by a loss of judgment, feelings of intense happiness (euphoria), a loss of  inhibition, and poor concentration. These neurologic changes cause significant  problems in an affected person's  and family life. As the disease  progresses, it causes a severe decline in thinking and reasoning abilities  (dementia). Affected people ultimately become unable to walk, speak, or care for  themselves. People with this disease usually live only into their thirties or  forties.

Description1: html:p Polycythemia vera is a condition characterized by an increased number of red  blood cells in the bloodstream. Affected individuals may also have excess white  blood cells and blood clotting cell fragments called platelets. These extra  cells and platelets cause the blood to be thicker than normal. As a result,  abnormal blood clots are more likely to form and block the flow of blood through  arteries and veins. Individuals with polycythemia vera have an increased risk  of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a type of blood clot that occurs in the deep  veins of the arms or legs. If a DVT travels through the bloodstream and lodges  in the lungs, it can cause a life-threatening clot known as a pulmonary embolism  (PE). Affected individuals also have an increased risk of heart attack and  stroke caused by blood clots in the heart and brain. html:p Polycythemia vera typically develops in adulthood, around age 60, although in  rare cases it occurs in children and young adults. This condition may not cause  any symptoms in its early stages. Some people with polycythemia vera experience  headaches, dizziness, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), impaired vision, or itchy  skin. Affected individuals frequently have reddened skin because of the extra  red blood cells. Other complications of polycythemia vera include an enlarged  spleen (splenomegaly), stomach ulcers, gout (a form of arthritis caused by a  buildup of uric acid in the joints), heart disease, and cancer of blood-forming  cells (leukemia).

When the  condition affects one side of the brain, researchers describe it as unilateral.  When it affects both sides of the brain, it is described as bilateral. The signs  and symptoms associated with polymicrogyria depend on how much of the brain,  and which particular brain regions, are affected. html:p Researchers have identified multiple forms of polymicrogyria. The mildest form  is known as unilateral focal polymicrogyria. This form of the condition affects  a relatively small area on one side of the brain. It may cause minor  neurological problems, such as mild  that can be easily controlled with  medication.

Signs and symptoms of these conditions can include recurrent  (), , crossed eyes, problems with  and  swallowing, and muscle weakness or paralysis. The most severe form of the  disorder, bilateral generalized polymicrogyria, affects the entire brain. This  condition causes severe  disability, problems with movement, and  that are difficult or impossible to control with medication. html:p Polymicrogyria most often occurs as an isolated feature, although it can occur  with other brain abnormalities. It is also a feature of several genetic  syndromes characterized by  disability and multiple birth defects.  These include 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Adams-Oliver syndrome, Aicardi  syndrome, Galloway-Mowat syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Zellweger spectrum  disorder.

Name1: Pompe disease
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pompe-disease
frequency1: Pompe disease affects about 1 in 40,000 people in the United States. The incidence of this disorder varies among different ethnic groups.
Description1: html:p Pompe disease is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of a complex sugar  called glycogen in the body's cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain  organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs their ability to function  normally. html:p Researchers have described three types of Pompe disease, which differ in  severity and the age at which they appear. These types are known as classic  infantile-onset, non-classic infantile-onset, and late-onset. html:p The classic form of infantile-onset Pompe disease begins within a few months of  birth. Infants with this disorder typically experience muscle weakness  (myopathy), poor muscle tone (), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and  s. Affected infants may also fail to gain weight and grow at the  expected rate (failure to thrive) and have breathing problems. If untreated,  this form of Pompe disease leads to death from heart failure in the first year  of life. html:p The non-classic form of infantile-onset Pompe disease usually appears by age 1.  It is characterized by delayed motor skills (such as rolling over and sitting)  and progressive muscle weakness. The heart may be abnormally large  (cardiomegaly), but affected individuals usually do not experience heart  failure. The muscle weakness in this disorder leads to serious breathing  problems, and most children with non-classic infantile-onset Pompe disease live  only into early childhood. html:p The late-onset type of Pompe disease may not become apparent until later in  childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Late-onset Pompe disease is usually milder  than the infantile-onset forms of this disorder and is less likely to involve  the heart. Most individuals with late-onset Pompe disease experience progressive  muscle weakness, especially in the legs and the trunk, including the muscles  that control breathing. As the disorder progresses, breathing problems can lead  to respiratory failure.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pontocerebellar-hypoplasia
frequency1: The prevalence of pontocerebellar hypoplasia is unknown, although most forms of the disorder appear to be very rare.
Description1: html:p Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a group of related conditions that affect the  development of the brain. The term"pontocerebellar"refers to the pons and the  cerebellum, which are the brain structures that are most severely affected in  many forms of this disorder. The pons is located at the base of the brain in an  area called the brainstem, where it transmits signals between the cerebellum and  the rest of the brain. The cerebellum, which is located at the back of the  brain, normally coordinates movement. The term"hypoplasia"refers to the  underdevelopment of these brain regions. html:p Pontocerebellar hypoplasia also causes impaired growth of other parts of the  brain, leading to an unusually small head size (microcephaly). This microcephaly  is usually not apparent at birth but becomes noticeable as brain growth  continues to be slow in infancy and early childhood. html:p Researchers have described at least ten types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. All  forms of this condition are characterized by  overall, problems with  . The brain abnormalities are usually present at birth, and in some  cases they can be detected before birth. Many children with pontocerebellar  hypoplasia live only into infancy or childhood, although some affected  individuals have lived into adulthood. html:p The two major forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are designated as type 1  (PCH1) and type 2 (PCH2). In addition to the brain abnormalities described  above, PCH1 causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of  specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord, similar to  another genetic disorder known as spinal muscular atrophy. Individuals with PCH1  also have very  (), joint deformities called  , vision impairment, and breathing and feeding problems that are  evident from early infancy. html:p Common features of PCH2 include a lack of voluntary motor skills (such as  grasping objects, sitting, or walking), problems with swallowing (dysphagia),  and an absence of , including . Affected children typically  develop temporary jitteriness (generalized clonus) in early infancy, abnormal  patterns of movement described as chorea or , and  . Many also have impaired vision and . html:p The other forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, designated as type 3 (PCH3)  through type 10 (PCH10), appear to be rare and have each been reported in only a  small number of individuals. Because the different types have overlapping  features, and some are caused by mutations in the same genes, researchers have  proposed that the types be considered as a spectrum instead of distinct  conditions.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">The exact prevalence of porphyria is unknown, but it probably ranges from 1</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">in 500 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. Overall, porphyria cutanea tarda is the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">most common type of porphyria. For some forms of porphyria, the prevalence is</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">unknown because many people with a genetic mutation associated with the disease</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">never experience signs or symptoms.Acute intermittent porphyria is the most</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">common form of acute porphyria in most countries. It may occur more frequently</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">in northern European countries, such as Sweden, and in the United Kingdom.</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Another form of the disorder, hereditary coproporphyria, has been reported</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">mostly in Europe and North America. Variegate porphyria is most common in the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Afrikaner population of South Africa; about 3 in 1,000 people in this population</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">have the genetic change that causes this form of the disorder.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Porphyria is a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the chemical steps</span>  that lead to heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's  organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme  is a component of several iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins,  including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood). html:p Researchers have identified several types of porphyria, which are distinguished  by their genetic cause and their signs and symptoms. Some types of porphyria,  called cutaneous porphyrias, primarily affect the skin. Areas of skin exposed to  the sun become fragile and blistered, which can lead to infection, scarring,  changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), and increased hair growth. Cutaneous  porphyrias include congenital erythropoietic porphyria, erythropoietic  protoporphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and porphyria cutanea tarda. html:p Other types of porphyria, called acute porphyrias, primarily affect the nervous  system. These disorders are described as"acute"because their signs and  symptoms appear quickly and usually last a short time. Episodes of acute  porphyria can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.  During an episode, a person may also experience muscle weakness, ,  fever, and mental changes such as  and hallucinations. These signs and  symptoms can be life-threatening, especially if the muscles that control  breathing become paralyzed. Acute porphyrias include acute intermittent  porphyria and ALAD deficiency porphyria. Two other forms of porphyria,  hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, can have both acute and  cutaneous symptoms. html:p The porphyrias can also be split into erythropoietic and hepatic types,  depending on where damaging compounds called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors  first build up in the body. In erythropoietic porphyrias, these compounds  originate in the bone marrow. Erythropoietic porphyrias include erythropoietic  protoporphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Health problems  associated with erythropoietic porphyrias include a low number of red blood  cells (anemia) and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). The other types of  porphyrias are considered hepatic porphyrias. In these disorders, porphyrins and  porphyrin precursors originate primarily in the liver, leading to abnormal  liver function and an increased risk of developing liver cancer. html:p Environmental factors can strongly influence the occurrence and severity of  signs and symptoms of porphyria. Alcohol, smoking, certain drugs, hormones,  other illnesses, stress, and dieting or periods without food (fasting) can all  trigger the signs and symptoms of some forms of the disorder. Additionally,  exposure to sunlight worsens the skin damage in people with cutaneous  porphyrias.

GHR-webpage1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/preeclampsia</span>
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Preeclampsia is a common condition in all populations, occurring in 5 to 8</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">percent of pregnancies. It occurs more frequently in women of African or</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Hispanic descent than it does in women of European descent.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy in which affected women develop high</span>  blood pressure (hypertension); they can also have abnormally high levels of  protein in their urine (proteinuria). This condition usually occurs in the last  few months of pregnancy and often requires early delivery of the infant. html:p Many women with mild preeclampsia do not feel ill, and the condition is often  first detected through blood pressure and urine testing in their doctor's  office. In addition to hypertension and proteinuria, signs and symptoms of  preeclampsia can include excessive swelling (edema) of the face or hands and a  weight gain of more than 3 to 5 pounds in a week due to fluid retention.  Affected women may also experience headaches, dizziness, irritability, shortness  of breath, a decrease in urination, upper abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  Vision changes may develop, including flashing lights or spots, increased  sensitivity to light (photophobia), blurry vision, or temporary blindness. html:p In many cases, symptoms of preeclampsia go away within a few days after the baby  is born. In severe cases, however, preeclampsia can damage the mother's organs,  such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, and can lead to life-threatening  complications. Extremely high blood pressure in the mother can cause bleeding in  the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The effects of high blood pressure on the brain  (hypertensive encephalopathy) may also result in . If  occur,  the condition is considered to have worsened to eclampsia, which can result in  coma. About 1 in 200 women with untreated preeclampsia develop eclampsia.  Eclampsia can also develop without any obvious signs of preeclampsia. html:p Between 10 and 20 percent of women with severe preeclampsia develop another  potentially life-threatening complication called HELLP syndrome. HELLP stands  for hemolysis (premature red blood cell breakdown), elevated liver enzyme  levels, and low platelets (cell fragments involved in blood clotting), which are  the key features of this condition. html:p Severe preeclampsia can also affect the fetus, with impairment of blood and  oxygen flow leading to  or stillbirth. Infants delivered early  due to preeclampsia may have complications associated with prematurity, such as  breathing problems caused by underdeveloped lungs. html:p Women who have had preeclampsia have approximately twice the lifetime risk of  heart disease and stroke than do women in the general population. Researchers  suggest that preeclampsia, heart disease, and stroke may share common risk  factors. Women who have health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, heart  disease, diabetes, or kidney disease before they become pregnant have an  increased risk of developing preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is most likely to occur  in a woman's first pregnancy, although it can occur in subsequent pregnancies,  particularly in women with other health conditions.

Description1: html:p Primary carnitine deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from using  certain fats for energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting).  Carnitine, a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is used by  cells to process fats and produce energy. html:p Signs and symptoms of primary carnitine deficiency typically appear during  infancy or early childhood and can include severe brain dysfunction  (encephalopathy), a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), confusion,  vomiting, muscle weakness, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). The severity of  this condition varies among affected individuals. Some people with primary  carnitine deficiency are asymptomatic, which means they do not have any signs or  symptoms of the condition. All individuals with this disorder are at risk for  heart failure, liver problems, coma, and sudden death. html:p Problems related to primary carnitine deficiency can be triggered by periods of  fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes  mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while  they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu.  Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these  viral infections.

Name1: Primary ciliary dyskinesia
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-ciliary-dyskinesia
frequency1: Primary ciliary dyskinesia occurs in approximately 1 in 16,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory  tract infections, abnormally positioned internal organs, and the inability to  have children (infertility). The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused  by abnormal cilia and flagella. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections  that stick out from the surface of cells. They are found in the linings of the  airway, the reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Flagella are  tail-like structures, similar to cilia, that propel sperm cells forward. html:p In the respiratory tract, cilia move back and forth in a coordinated way to move  mucus towards the throat. This movement of mucus helps to eliminate fluid,  bacteria, and particles from the lungs. Most babies with primary ciliary  dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth, which suggests that cilia  play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Beginning in  early childhood, affected individuals develop frequent respiratory tract  infections. Without properly functioning cilia in the airway, bacteria remain in  the respiratory tract and cause infection. People with primary ciliary  dyskinesia also have year-round nasal congestion and a chronic cough. Chronic  respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis,  which damages the passages, called bronchi, leading from the windpipe to the  lungs and can cause life-threatening breathing problems. html:p Some individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organs  within their chest and abdomen. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic  development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body  are established. About 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have  a mirror-image reversal of their internal organs (situs inversus totalis). For  example, in these individuals the heart is on the right side of the body instead  of on the left. Situs inversus totalis does not cause any apparent health  problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus  totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome. html:p Approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a  condition known as heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus, which is characterized  by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may  be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected  individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia).  Heterotaxy syndrome results from problems establishing the left and right sides  of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy varies  widely among affected individuals. html:p Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility. Vigorous movements of  the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the female egg  cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary  dyskinesia are usually unable to father children. Infertility occurs in some  affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes. html:p Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections  (otitis media), especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent  hearing loss if untreated. The ear infections are likely related to abnormal  cilia within the inner ear. html:p Rarely, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of  fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), likely due to abnormal cilia in the brain.

frequency1: The prevalence of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is thought to be less than 1 in 100,000 people.
Description1: html:p Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the  body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the  disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10. html:p The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary  coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition  becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with  muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These  problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10  deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar  ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in  the part of the brain that is involved in  (cerebellum).  Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10  deficiency include ,  disability, poor muscle tone  , progressive  , abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused  by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing  tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss  (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems  gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation. html:p A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature  of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological  abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs  their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine  (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased  cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in  the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected individuals may  also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a reduced number of  red blood cells in the body (anemia), abnormal blood clotting, or reduced  amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can lead to a  weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with nephrotic  syndrome. If not treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation, affected individuals  eventually develop irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). html:p A type of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle (hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy) can also occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency.

Name1: Primary hyperoxaluria

frequency1: Primary hyperoxaluria is estimated to affect 1 in 58,000 individuals worldwide. Type 1 is the most common form, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. Types 2 and 3 each account for about 10 percent of cases.
Description1: html:p Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare condition characterized by recurrent kidney and  bladder stones. The condition often results in end stage renal disease (ESRD),  which is a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering  fluids and waste products from the body effectively. html:p Primary hyperoxaluria results from the overproduction of a substance called  oxalate. Oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and excreted as a waste product  in urine, leading to abnormally high levels of this substance in urine  (hyperoxaluria). During its excretion, oxalate can combine with calcium to form  calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and  bladder stones. Deposits of calcium oxalate can damage the kidneys and other  organs and lead to blood in the urine (hematuria), urinary tract infections,  kidney damage, ESRD, and injury to other organs. Over time, kidney function  decreases such that the kidneys can no longer excrete as much oxalate as they  receive. As a result oxalate levels in the blood rise, and the substance gets  deposited in tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis), particularly in  bones and the walls of blood vessels. Oxalosis in bones can cause fractures. html:p There are three types of primary hyperoxaluria that differ in their severity and  genetic cause. In primary hyperoxaluria type 1, kidney stones typically begin  to appear anytime from childhood to early adulthood, and ESRD can develop at any  age. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is similar to type 1, but ESRD develops later  in life. In primary hyperoxaluria type 3, affected individuals often develop  kidney stones in early childhood, but few cases of this type have been described  so additional signs and symptoms of this type are unclear.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) is a condition in which clumps of</span>  abnormal proteins called amyloids build up in the skin, specifically in the  wave-like projections (dermal papillae) between the top two layers of skin (the  dermis and the epidermis). The primary feature of PLCA is patches of skin with  abnormal texture or color. The appearance of these patches defines three forms  of the condition: lichen amyloidosis, macular amyloidosis, and nodular  amyloidosis. html:p Lichen amyloidosis is characterized by severely itchy patches of thickened skin  with multiple small bumps. The patches are scaly and reddish brown in color.  These patches usually occur on the shins but can also occur on the forearms,  other parts of the legs, and elsewhere on the body. html:p In macular amyloidosis, the patches are flat and dark brown. The coloring can  have a lacy (reticulated) or rippled appearance, although it is often uniform.  Macular amyloidosis patches are most commonly found on the upper back, but they  can also occur on other parts of the torso or on the limbs. These patches are  mildly itchy. html:p Nodular amyloidosis is characterized by firm, raised bumps (nodules) that are  pink, red, or brown. These nodules often occur on the face, torso, limbs, or  genitals and are typically not itchy. html:p In some affected individuals, the patches have characteristics of both lichen  and macular amyloidosis. These cases are called biphasic amyloidosis. html:p In all forms of PLCA, the abnormal patches of skin usually arise in  mid-adulthood. They can remain for months to years and may recur after  disappearing, either at the same location or elsewhere. Very rarely, nodular  amyloidosis progresses to a life-threatening condition called systemic  amyloidosis, in which amyloid deposits accumulate in tissues and organs  throughout the body.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-macronodular-adrenal-hyperplasia
frequency1: PMAH is a rare disorder. It is present in less than 1 percent of cases of endogenous Cushing syndrome, which describes forms of Cushing syndrome caused by factors internal to the body rather than by external factors such as long-term use of certain medicines called corticosteroids. The prevalence of endogenous Cushing syndrome is about 1 in 26,000 people.
Description1: html:p Primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH) is a disorder characterized by  multiple lumps (nodules) in the adrenal glands, which are small  hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. These nodules, which  usually are found in both adrenal glands (bilateral) and vary in size, cause  adrenal gland enlargement (hyperplasia) and result in the production of  higher-than-normal levels of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is an important  hormone that suppresses inflammation and protects the body from physical stress  such as infection or trauma through several mechanisms including raising blood  sugar levels. html:p PMAH typically becomes evident in a person's forties or fifties. It is  considered a form of Cushing syndrome, which is characterized by increased  levels of cortisol resulting from one of many possible causes. These increased  cortisol levels lead to weight gain in the face and upper body, fragile skin,  bone loss, fatigue, and other health problems. However, some people with PMAH do  not experience these signs and symptoms and are said to have subclinical  Cushing syndrome.

frequency1: Primary myelofibrosis is a rare condition that affects approximately 1 in 500,000 people worldwide.
Description1: html:p Primary myelofibrosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of scar tissue  (fibrosis) in the bone marrow, the tissue that produces blood cells. Because of  the fibrosis, the bone marrow is unable to make enough normal blood cells. The  shortage of blood cells causes many of the signs and symptoms of primary  myelofibrosis. html:p Initially, most people with primary myelofibrosis have no signs or symptoms.  Eventually, fibrosis can lead to a reduction in the number of red blood cells,  white blood cells, and platelets. A shortage of red blood cells (anemia) often  causes extreme tiredness (fatigue) or shortness of breath. A loss of white blood  cells can lead to an increased number of infections, and a reduction of  platelets can cause easy bleeding or bruising. html:p Because blood cell formation (hematopoiesis) in the bone marrow is disrupted,  other organs such as the spleen or liver may begin to produce blood cells. This  process, called extramedullary hematopoiesis, often leads to an enlarged spleen  (splenomegaly) or an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). People with splenomegaly may  feel pain or fullness in the abdomen, especially below the ribs on the left  side. Other common signs and symptoms of primary myelofibrosis include fever,  night sweats, and bone pain. html:p Primary myelofibrosis is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 50 to 80 but can  occur at any age.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis
frequency1: An estimated 1 in 10,000 people have primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the condition is diagnosed in approximately 1 in 100,000 people per year worldwide.
Description1: html:p Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a condition that affects the bile ducts. These  ducts carry bile (a fluid that helps to digest fats) from the liver, where bile  is produced, to the gallbladder, where it is stored, and to the small  intestine, where it aids in digestion. Primary sclerosing cholangitis occurs  because of inflammation in the bile ducts (cholangitis) that leads to scarring  (sclerosis) and narrowing of the ducts. As a result, bile cannot be released to  the gallbladder and small intestine, and it builds up in the liver. html:p Primary sclerosing cholangitis is usually diagnosed around age 40, and for  unknown reasons, it affects men twice as often as women. Many people have no  signs or symptoms of the condition when they are diagnosed, but routine blood  tests reveal liver problems. When apparent, the earliest signs and symptoms of  primary sclerosing cholangitis include extreme tiredness (fatigue), discomfort  in the abdomen, and severe itchiness (pruritus). As the condition worsens,  affected individuals may develop yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes  (jaundice) and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). Eventually, the buildup of  bile damages the liver cells, causing chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) and  liver failure. Without bile available to digest them, fats pass through the  body. As a result, weight loss and shortages of vitamins that are absorbed with  and stored in fats (fat-soluble vitamins) can occur. A fat-soluble vitamin  called vitamin D helps absorb calcium and helps bones harden, and lack of this  vitamin can cause thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) in people with primary  sclerosing cholangitis. html:p Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often associated with another condition called  inflammatory bowel disease, which is characterized by inflammation of the  intestines that causes open sores (ulcers) in the intestines and abdominal pain.  However, the reason for this link is unclear. Approximately 70 percent of  people with primary sclerosing cholangitis have inflammatory bowel disease, most  commonly a form of the condition known as ulcerative colitis. In addition,  people with primary sclerosing cholangitis are more likely to have an autoimmune  disorder, such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, or thyroid disease, than  people without the condition. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system  malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. People with primary  sclerosing cholangitis also have an increased risk of developing cancer,  particularly cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma).

frequency1: Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is more common in men than in women. This condition occurs in 7.4 to 18 per 100,000 men each year and 1.2 to 6 per 100,000 women each year.
Description1: html:p Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is an abnormal accumulation of air in the space  between the lungs and the chest cavity (called the pleural space) that can  result in the partial or complete collapse of a lung. This type of pneumothorax  is described as primary because it occurs in the absence of lung disease such as  emphysema. Spontaneous means the pneumothorax was not caused by an injury such  as a rib fracture. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is likely due to the  formation of small sacs of air (blebs) in lung tissue that rupture, causing air  to leak into the pleural space. Air in the pleural space creates pressure on the  lung and can lead to its collapse. A person with this condition may feel chest  pain on the side of the collapsed lung and shortness of breath. html:p Blebs may be present on an individual's lung (or lungs) for a long time before  they rupture. Many things can cause a bleb to rupture, such as changes in air  pressure or a very sudden deep breath. Often, people who experience a primary  spontaneous pneumothorax have no prior sign of illness; the blebs themselves  typically do not cause any symptoms and are visible only on medical imaging.  Affected individuals may have one bleb to more than thirty blebs. Once a bleb  ruptures and causes a pneumothorax, there is an estimated 13 to 60 percent  chance that the condition will recur.

frequency1: The prevalence of progressive external ophthalmoplegia is unknown.
Description1: html:p Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a condition characterized by weakness of  the eye muscles. The condition typically appears in adults between ages 18 and  40 and slowly worsens over time. The first sign of progressive external  ophthalmoplegia is typically drooping eyelids (ptosis), which can affect one or  both eyelids. As ptosis worsens, affected individuals may use the forehead  muscles to try to lift the eyelids, or they may lift up their chin in order to  see. Another characteristic feature of progressive external ophthalmoplegia is  weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eye (ophthalmoplegia).  Affected individuals have to turn their head to see in different directions,  especially as the ophthalmoplegia worsens. People with progressive external  ophthalmoplegia may also have general weakness of the muscles used for movement  (myopathy), particularly those in the neck, arms, or legs. The weakness may be  especially noticeable during exercise (exercise intolerance). Muscle weakness  may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). html:p When the muscle cells of affected individuals are stained and viewed under a  microscope, these cells usually appear abnormal. These abnormal muscle cells  contain an excess of cell structures called mitochondria and are known as  ragged-red fibers. html:p Although muscle weakness is the primary symptom of progressive external  ophthalmoplegia, this condition can be accompanied by other signs and symptoms.  In these instances, the condition is referred to as progressive external  ophthalmoplegia plus (PEO+). Additional signs and symptoms can include hearing  loss caused by nerve damage in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss),  weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage (neuropathy),  , a pattern of movement abnormalities known  as parkinsonism, and . html:p Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is part of a spectrum of disorders with  overlapping signs and symptoms. Similar disorders include ataxia neuropathy  spectrum and Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Like progressive external ophthalmoplegia,  the other conditions in this spectrum can involve weakness of the eye muscles.  However, these conditions have many additional features not shared by most  people with progressive external ophthalmoplegia.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal</span>  beating of the heart. A normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals  that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. These signals begin in  a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural  pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). From there, a  group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals  to another cluster of cells called the bundle of His. This bundle separates into  multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals  into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). Electrical impulses move from  the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat  in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria. html:p Heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the  atria to the ventricles. In people with progressive familial heart block, the  condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are  partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any  signals from passing through the heart. Partial heart block causes a slow or  irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to  the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical  impulses. Fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block,  resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the  ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. Complete heart block  can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations),  shortness of breath, fainting (syncope), or sudden cardiac arrest and death. html:p Progressive familial heart block can be divided into type I and type II, with  type I being further divided into types IA and IB. These types differ in where  in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. In types IA and IB,  the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type II, the heart  block originates in the atrioventricular node. The different types of  progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms. html:p Most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive  familial heart block. The most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the  heart, which occurs as a normal process of aging. Other causes of heart block  can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue.

Name1: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-familial-intrahepatic-cholestasis
frequency1: PFIC is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 people worldwide. PFIC type 1 is much more common in the Inuit population of Greenland and the Old Order Amish population of the United States.
Description1: html:p Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a disorder that causes  progressive liver disease, which typically leads to liver failure. In people  with PFIC, liver cells are less able to secrete a digestive fluid called bile.  The buildup of bile in liver cells causes liver disease in affected individuals. html:p Signs and symptoms of PFIC typically begin in infancy and are related to bile  buildup and liver disease. Specifically, affected individuals experience severe  itching, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), failure to  gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), high blood  pressure in the vein that supplies blood to the liver (portal hypertension), and  an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). html:p There are three known types of PFIC: PFIC1, PFIC2, and PFIC3. The types are  also sometimes described as shortages of particular proteins needed for normal  liver function. Each type has a different genetic cause. html:p In addition to signs and symptoms related to liver disease, people with PFIC1  may have , deafness, diarrhea, inflammation of the pancreas  (pancreatitis), and low levels of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K)  in the blood. Affected individuals typically develop liver failure before  adulthood. html:p The signs and symptoms of PFIC2 are typically related to liver disease only;  however, these signs and symptoms tend to be more severe than those experienced  by people with PFIC1. People with PFIC2 often develop liver failure within the  first few years of life. Additionally, affected individuals are at increased  risk of developing a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. html:p Most people with PFIC3 have signs and symptoms related to liver disease only.  Signs and symptoms of PFIC3 usually do not appear until later in infancy or  early childhood; rarely, people are diagnosed in early adulthood. Liver failure  can occur in childhood or adulthood in people with PFIC3.

frequency1: Progressive osseous heteroplasia is a rare condition. Its exact incidence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Progressive osseous heteroplasia is a disorder in which bone forms within skin  and muscle tissue. Bone that forms outside the skeleton is called heterotopic or  ectopic bone. In progressive osseous heteroplasia, ectopic bone formation  begins in the deep layers of the skin (dermis and subcutaneous fat) and  gradually moves into other tissues such as skeletal muscle and tendons. The bony  lesions within the skin may be painful and may develop into open sores  (ulcers). Over time, joints can become involved, resulting in impaired mobility. html:p Signs and symptoms of progressive osseous heteroplasia usually become noticeable  during infancy. In some affected individuals, however, this may not occur until  later in childhood or in early adulthood.

Name1: Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-pseudorheumatoid-dysplasia
frequency1: PPRD has been estimated to occur in approximately 1 per million people in the United Kingdom. The condition is thought to be more common in Turkey and the Middle East, although its prevalence in these regions is unknown. The condition in all regions is likely underdiagnosed because it is often misdiagnosed as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
Description1: html:p Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPRD) is a joint disease that worsens  over time. This condition is characterized by breakdown (degeneration) of the  cartilage between bones (articular cartilage). This cartilage covers and  protects the ends of bones, and its degeneration leads to pain and stiffness in  the joints and other features of PPRD. html:p PPRD usually begins in childhood, between ages 3 and 8. The first indications  are usually an abnormal walking pattern, weakness and fatigue when active, and  stiffness in the joints in the fingers and in the knees. Other signs and  symptoms that develop over time include permanently bent fingers  (camptodactyly), enlarged finger and knee joints (often mistaken as swelling),  and a reduced amount of space between the bones at the hip and knee joints. Hip  pain is a common problem by adolescence. Affected individuals have flattened  bones in the spine (platyspondyly) that are abnormally shaped (beaked), which  leads to an abnormal front-to-back curvature of the spine (kyphosis) and a short  torso. At birth, people with PPRD are of normal length, but by adulthood, they  are usually shorter than their peers. Affected adults also have abnormal  deposits of calcium around the elbow, knee, and hip joints and limited movement  in all joints, including those of the spine. html:p PPRD is often mistaken for another joint disorder that affects young people  called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. However, the joint problems in juvenile  rheumatoid arthritis are associated with inflammation, while those in PPRD are  not.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-supranuclear-palsy
frequency1: The exact prevalence of progressive supranuclear palsy is unknown. It may affect about 6 in 100,000 people worldwide.
Description1: html:p Progressive supranuclear palsy is a brain disorder that affects movement,  vision, , and thinking ability (cognition). The signs and symptoms of this  disorder usually become apparent in mid- to late adulthood, most often in a  person's 60s. Most people with progressive supranuclear palsy survive 5 to 9  years after the disease first appears, although a few affected individuals have  lived for more than a decade. html:p Loss of balance and frequent falls are the most common early signs of  progressive supranuclear palsy. Affected individuals have problems with walking,  including poor coordination and an unsteady, lurching gait. Other movement  abnormalities develop as the disease progresses, including unusually slow  movements (bradykinesia), clumsiness, and stiffness of the trunk muscles. These  problems worsen with time, and most affected people ultimately require  wheelchair assistance. html:p Progressive supranuclear palsy is also characterized by abnormal eye movements,  which typically develop several years after the other movement problems first  appear. Restricted up-and-down eye movement (vertical gaze palsy) is a hallmark  of this disease. Other eye movement problems include difficulty opening and  closing the eyelids, infrequent blinking, and pulling back (retraction) of the  eyelids. These abnormalities can lead to blurred vision, an increased  sensitivity to light (photophobia), and a staring gaze. html:p Additional features of progressive supranuclear palsy include slow and slurred  () and trouble swallowing (dysphagia). Most affected  individuals also experience changes in personality and behavior, such as a  general loss of interest and enthusiasm (apathy). They develop problems with  cognition, including difficulties with attention, planning, and problem solving.  As the cognitive and  problems worsen, affected individuals  increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily  living.

Description1: html:p Prolidase deficiency is a disorder that causes a wide variety of symptoms. The  disorder typically becomes apparent during infancy. Affected individuals may  have enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly); in some cases, both the spleen  and liver are enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly). Diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration  may also occur. People with prolidase deficiency are susceptible to severe  infections of the skin or ears, or potentially life-threatening respiratory  tract infections. Some individuals with prolidase deficiency have chronic lung  disease. html:p Characteristic facial features in people with prolidase deficiency include  prominent eyes that are widely spaced (hypertelorism), a high forehead, a flat  bridge of the nose, and a very small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia). Affected  children may experience , and about 75 percent of people  with prolidase deficiency have  disability that may range from mild  to severe. html:p People with prolidase deficiency often develop skin lesions, especially on their  hands, feet, lower legs, and face. The severity of the skin involvement, which  usually begins during childhood, may range from a mild rash to severe skin  ulcers. Skin ulcers, especially on the legs, may not heal completely, resulting  in complications including infection and amputation. html:p The severity of symptoms in prolidase deficiency varies greatly among affected  individuals. Some people with this disorder do not have any symptoms. In these  individuals the condition can be detected by laboratory tests such as newborn  screening tests or tests offered to relatives of affected individuals.

frequency1: POMC deficiency is a rare condition; approximately 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency causes severe obesity that begins at an  early age. In addition to obesity, people with this condition have low levels of  a hormone known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and tend to have red hair  and pale skin. html:p Affected infants are usually a normal weight at birth, but they are constantly  hungry, which leads to excessive feeding (hyperphagia). The babies continuously  gain weight and are severely obese by age 1. Affected individuals experience  excessive hunger and remain obese for life. It is unclear if these individuals  are prone to weight-related conditions like cardiovascular disease or type 2  diabetes. html:p Low levels of ACTH lead to a condition called adrenal insufficiency, which  occurs when the pair of small glands on top of the kidneys (the adrenal glands)  do not produce enough hormones. Adrenal insufficiency often results in periods  of severely low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in people with POMC deficiency, which  can cause , elevated levels of a toxic substance called bilirubin in  the blood (hyperbilirubinemia), and a reduced ability to produce and release a  digestive fluid called bile (cholestasis). Without early treatment, adrenal  insufficiency can be fatal. html:p Pale skin that easily burns when exposed to the sun and red hair are common in  POMC deficiency, although not everyone with the condition has these  characteristics.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Prostate cancer is a common disease that affects men, usually in middle age or</span>  later. In this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and  multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The prostate is a gland that  surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries  sperm. html:p Early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit  no noticeable symptoms. Men are often diagnosed as the result of health  screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific  antigen (PSA) or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. As the tumor  grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the  flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely,  blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. However, these changes  can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. Having one or more of  these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer. html:p The severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. Early-stage prostate  cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate  tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during  their lifetime, even without treatment. In other men, however, the cancer is  much more ; in these cases, prostate cancer can be life-threatening. html:p Some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of  the body. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the  body are called metastatic cancers. The signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer  depend on where the disease has spread. If prostate cancer spreads, cancerous  cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. Bone  metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis,  or hips. html:p A small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. These hereditary  cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary prostate  cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases.

These clots occur in the deep veins of  the arms or legs, away from the surface of the skin. A DVT can travel through  the bloodstream and lodge in the lungs, causing a life-threatening blockage of  blood flow known as a pulmonary embolism (PE). While most people with mild  protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots, certain factors can add  to the risk of their development. These factors include increased age, surgery,  inactivity, or pregnancy. Having another inherited disorder of blood clotting  in addition to protein C deficiency can also influence the risk of abnormal  blood clotting. html:p In severe cases of protein C deficiency, infants develop a life-threatening  blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth. Purpura  fulminans is characterized by the formation of blood clots in the small blood  vessels throughout the body. These blood clots block normal blood flow and can  lead to localized death of body tissue (necrosis). Widespread blood clotting  uses up all available blood clotting proteins. As a result, abnormal bleeding  occurs in various parts of the body, which can cause large, purple patches on  the skin. Individuals who survive the newborn period may experience recurrent  episodes of purpura fulminans.

Name1: Proteus syndrome
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/proteus-syndrome
frequency1: Proteus syndrome is a rare condition with an incidence of less than 1 in 1 million people worldwide. Only a few hundred affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature.Researchers believe that Proteus syndrome may be overdiagnosed, as some individuals with other conditions featuring asymmetric overgrowth have been mistakenly diagnosed with Proteus syndrome. To make an accurate diagnosis, most doctors and researchers now follow a set of strict guidelines that define the signs and symptoms of Proteus syndrome.
Description1: html:p Proteus syndrome is a rare condition characterized by overgrowth of the bones,  skin, and other tissues. Organs and tissues affected by the disease grow out of  proportion to the rest of the body. The overgrowth is usually asymmetric, which  means it affects the right and left sides of the body differently. Newborns with  Proteus syndrome have few or no signs of the condition.  Becomes  apparent between the ages of 6 and 18 months and gets more severe with age. html:p In people with Proteus syndrome, the pattern of  varies greatly but  can affect almost any part of the body. Bones in the limbs, skull, and spine are  often affected. The condition can also cause a variety of skin growths,  particularly a thick, raised, and deeply grooved lesion known as a cerebriform  connective tissue nevus. This type of skin growth usually occurs on the soles of  the feet and is hardly ever seen in conditions other than Proteus syndrome.  Blood vessels (vascular tissue) and fat (adipose tissue) can also grow  abnormally in Proteus syndrome. html:p Some people with Proteus syndrome have neurological abnormalities, including  disability, , and vision loss. Affected individuals may  also have distinctive facial features such as a long face, outside corners of  the eyes that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures), a low nasal  bridge with wide nostrils, and an open-mouth expression. For reasons that are  unclear, affected people with neurological symptoms are more likely to have  distinctive facial features than those without neurological symptoms. It is  unclear how these signs and symptoms are related to html:p Other potential complications of Proteus syndrome include an increased risk of  developing various types of noncancerous (benign) tumors and a type of blood  clot called a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVTs occur most often in the deep  veins of the legs or arms. If these clots travel through the bloodstream, they  can lodge in the lungs and cause a life-threatening complication called a  pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a common cause of death in people with  Proteus syndrome.

frequency1: Prothrombin deficiency is very rare; it is estimated to affect 1 in 2 million people in the general population.
Description1: html:p Prothrombin deficiency is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting  process. People with this condition often experience prolonged bleeding  following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases of  prothrombin deficiency, heavy bleeding occurs after minor trauma or even in the  absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Women with prothrombin deficiency can  have prolonged and sometimes abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding. Serious  complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other  internal organs. Milder forms of prothrombin deficiency do not involve  spontaneous bleeding, and the condition may only become apparent following  surgery or a serious injury.

Description1: html:p Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a condition characterized by problems  regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation, which is  important for blood pressure and fluid balance, primarily occurs in the kidneys.  However, sodium can also be removed from the body through other tissues, such  as the sweat glands and colon. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is named for its  characteristic signs and symptoms, which mimic (pseudo) low levels (hypo) of a  hormone called aldosterone that helps regulate sodium levels. However, people  with PHA1 have high levels of aldosterone. html:p There are two types of PHA1 distinguished by their severity, the genes involved,  and how they are inherited. One type, called autosomal dominant PHA1 (also  known as renal PHA1) is characterized by excessive sodium loss from the kidneys.  This form of the condition is relatively mild and often improves in early  childhood. The other type, called autosomal recessive PHA1 (also known as  generalized or systemic PHA1) is characterized by sodium loss from the kidneys  and other organs, including the sweat glands, salivary glands, and colon. This  type of PHA1 is more severe and does not improve with age. html:p The earliest signs of both types of PHA1 are usually the inability to gain  weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and dehydration, which  are typically seen in infants. The characteristic features of both types of PHA1  are excessive amounts of sodium released in the urine (salt wasting), which  leads to low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia), and high levels of  potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). Infants with PHA1 can also have high  levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis). Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or  metabolic acidosis can cause nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,  extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness in infants with PHA1. html:p Infants with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have additional signs and symptoms due  to the involvement of multiple organs. Affected individuals may experience  episodes of abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia) or shock because of the  imbalance of salts in the body. They may also have recurrent lung infections or  lesions on the skin. Although adults with autosomal recessive PHA1 can have  repeated episodes of salt wasting, they do not usually have other signs and  symptoms of the condition.

Description1: html:p Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2) is caused by problems that affect  regulation of the amount of sodium and potassium in the body. Sodium and  potassium are important in the control of blood pressure, and their regulation  occurs primarily in the kidneys. html:p People with PHA2 have high blood pressure (hypertension) and high levels of  potassium in their blood (hyperkalemia) despite having normal kidney function.  The age of onset of PHA2 is variable and difficult to pinpoint; some affected  individuals are diagnosed in infancy or childhood, and others are diagnosed in  adulthood. Hyperkalemia usually occurs first, and hypertension develops later in  life. Affected individuals also have high levels of chloride (hyperchloremia)  and acid (metabolic acidosis) in their blood (together, referred to as  hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). People with hyperkalemia, hyperchloremia,  and metabolic acidosis can have nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting,  extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness. People with PHA2 may also have  high levels of calcium in their urine (hypercalciuria).

frequency1: PXE affects approximately 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. For reasons that are unclear, this disorder is diagnosed twice as frequently in females as in males.
Description1: html:p Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a progressive disorder that is characterized  by the accumulation of deposits of calcium and other minerals (mineralization)  in elastic fibers. Elastic fibers are a component of connective tissue, which  provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. html:p In PXE, mineralization can affect elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and blood  vessels, and less frequently in other areas such as the digestive tract. People  with PXE may have yellowish bumps called papules on their necks, underarms, and  other areas of skin that touch when a joint bends (flexor areas). They may also  have abnormalities in the eyes, such as a change in the pigmented cells of the  retina (the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye) known as peau  d'orange. Another eye abnormality known as angioid streaks occurs when tiny  breaks form in the layer of tissue under the retina called Bruch's membrane.  Bleeding and scarring of the retina may also occur, which can cause vision loss. html:p Mineralization of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest  of the body (arteries) may cause other signs and symptoms of PXE. For example,  people with this condition can develop narrowing of the arteries  (arteriosclerosis) or a condition called claudication that is characterized by  cramping and pain during exercise due to decreased blood flow to the arms and  legs. Rarely, bleeding from blood vessels in the digestive tract may also occur.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Psoriatic arthritis affects an estimated 24 in 10,000 people.Between 5 and</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">10 percent of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis, according to</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">most estimates. Some studies suggest a figure as high as 30 percent. Psoriasis</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">itself is a common disorder, affecting approximately 2 to 3 percent of the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">population worldwide.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Psoriatic arthritis is a condition involving joint inflammation (arthritis) that</span>  usually occurs in combination with a skin disorder called psoriasis. Psoriasis  is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by patches of red, irritated  skin that are often covered by flaky white scales. People with psoriasis may  also have changes in their fingernails and toenails, such as nails that become  pitted or ridged, crumble, or separate from the nail beds. html:p Signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include stiff, painful joints with  redness, heat, and swelling in the surrounding tissues. When the hands and feet  are affected, swelling and redness may result in a"sausage-like"appearance of  the fingers or toes (dactylitis). html:p In most people with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis appears before joint problems  develop. Psoriasis typically begins during adolescence or young adulthood, and  psoriatic arthritis usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50. However, both  conditions may occur at any age. In a small number of cases, psoriatic arthritis  develops in the absence of noticeable skin changes. html:p Psoriatic arthritis may be difficult to distinguish from other forms of  arthritis, particularly when skin changes are minimal or absent. Nail changes  and dactylitis are two features that are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis,  although they do not occur in all cases. html:p Psoriatic arthritis is categorized into five types: distal interphalangeal  predominant, asymmetric oligoarticular, symmetric polyarthritis, spondylitis,  and arthritis mutilans. html:p The distal interphalangeal predominant type affects mainly the ends of the  fingers and toes. The distal interphalangeal joints are those closest to the  nails. Nail changes are especially frequent with this form of psoriatic  arthritis. html:p The asymmetric oligoarticular and symmetric polyarthritis types are the most  common forms of psoriatic arthritis. The asymmetric oligoarticular type of  psoriatic arthritis involves different joints on each side of the body, while  the symmetric polyarthritis form affects the same joints on each side. Any joint  in the body may be affected in these forms of the disorder, and symptoms range  from mild to severe. html:p Some individuals with psoriatic arthritis have joint involvement that primarily  involves spondylitis, which is inflammation in the joints between the vertebrae  in the spine. Symptoms of this form of the disorder involve pain and stiffness  in the back or neck, and movement is often impaired. Joints in the arms, legs,  hands, and feet may also be involved. html:p The most severe and least common type of psoriatic arthritis is called arthritis  mutilans. Fewer than 5 percent of individuals with psoriatic arthritis have  this form of the disorder. Arthritis mutilans involves severe inflammation that  damages the joints in the hands and feet, resulting in deformation and movement  problems. Bone loss (osteolysis) at the joints may lead to shortening  (telescoping) of the fingers and toes. Neck and back pain may also occur.

frequency1: Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown. About 600 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature, of whom about a quarter are of Turkish descent. The remainder come from populations worldwide.
Description1: html:p Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a disorder in which many tiny fragments  (microliths) of a compound called calcium phosphate gradually accumulate in the  small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. These deposits eventually  cause widespread damage to the alveoli and surrounding lung tissue  (interstitial lung disease) that leads to breathing problems. People with this  disorder can develop a persistent cough and difficulty breathing (dyspnea),  especially during physical exertion. Affected individuals may also experience  chest pain that worsens when coughing, sneezing, or taking deep breaths. html:p Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is usually diagnosed before age 40. Often the  disorder is discovered before symptoms develop, when medical imaging is done for  other reasons. The condition typically worsens slowly over many years, although  some affected individuals have signs and symptoms that remain stable for long  periods of time. html:p People with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis can also develop calcium phosphate  deposits in other organs and tissues of the body, including the kidneys,  gallbladder, testes, and the valve that connects a large blood vessel called the  aorta with the heart (the aortic valve). In rare cases, affected individuals  have complications related to accumulation of these deposits, such as a  narrowing (stenosis) of the aortic valve that can impede normal blood flow.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive disorder characterized by</span>  abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension) in the pulmonary artery, the blood  vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. Pulmonary arterial  hypertension is one form of a broader condition known as pulmonary hypertension.  Pulmonary hypertension occurs when most of the very small arteries throughout  the lungs narrow in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow  through the lungs. To overcome the increased resistance, blood pressure  increases in the pulmonary artery and in the right ventricle of the heart, which  is the chamber that pumps blood into the pulmonary artery. Ultimately, the  increased blood pressure can damage the right ventricle of the heart. html:p Signs and symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension occur when increased blood  pressure cannot fully overcome the elevated resistance. As a result, the flow  of oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body is insufficient.  Shortness of breath (dyspnea) during exertion and fainting spells are the most  common symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. People with this disorder  may experience additional symptoms, particularly as the condition worsens.  Other symptoms include dizziness, swelling (edema) of the ankles or legs, chest  pain, and a rapid heart rate.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease
frequency1: The exact prevalence of PVOD is unknown. Many cases are likely misdiagnosed as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries without a known cause. Research suggests that 5 to 25 percent of people diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension have PVOD. Based on these numbers, PVOD is thought to affect an estimated 1 to 2 per 10 million people.
Description1: html:p Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is characterized by the blockage  (occlusion) of the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich (oxygenated) blood from  the lungs to the heart (the pulmonary veins). The occlusion is caused by a  buildup of abnormal fibrous tissue in the small veins in the lungs, which  narrows the vessels and impairs blood flow. Because blood flow through the lungs  is difficult, pressure rises in the vessels that carry blood that needs to be  oxygenated to the lungs from the heart (the pulmonary arteries). Increased  pressure in these vessels is known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. html:p The problems with blood flow in PVOD also impair the delivery of oxygenated  blood to the rest of the body, which leads to the signs and symptoms of the  condition. Shortness of breath (dyspnea) and tiredness (fatigue) during exertion  are the most common symptoms of this condition. Other common features include  dizziness, a lack of energy (lethargy), difficulty breathing when lying down,  and a cough that does not go away. As the condition worsens, affected  individuals can develop a bluish tint to the skin (cyanosis), chest pains,  fainting spells, and an accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). html:p Certain features commonly seen in people with PVOD can be identified using a  test called a CT scan. One of these features, which is seen in the lungs of  affected individuals, is an abnormality described as centrilobular ground-glass  opacities. Affected individuals also have abnormal thickening of certain tissues  in the lungs, which is described as septal lines. In addition, lymph nodes in  the chest (mediastinal lymph nodes) are abnormally enlarged in people with PVOD. html:p PVOD can begin at any age, and the blood flow problems worsen over time. Because  of the increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, the heart must work  harder than normal to pump blood to the lungs, which can eventually lead to  fatal heart failure. Most people with this severe disorder do not live more than  2 years after diagnosis.

Description1: html:p Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency is one of several disorders that  damage the immune system and cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).  People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from foreign invaders such  as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Affected individuals are prone to repeated and  persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. These  infections are often caused by"opportunistic"organisms that ordinarily do not  cause illness in people with a normal immune system. Infants with SCID typically  grow much more slowly than healthy children and experience pneumonia, chronic  diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. Without successful treatment to restore  immune function, children with SCID usually do not survive past early childhood. html:p About two-thirds of individuals with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency  have neurological problems, which may include  , , and  . People with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency  are also at increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, which occur when  the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs.

Description1: html:p Pyle disease is a disorder of the bones. Its hallmark feature is an abnormality  of the long bones in the arms and legs in which the ends (metaphyses) of the  bones are abnormally broad; the shape of the bones resembles a boat oar or  paddle. The broad metaphyses are due to enlargement of the spongy inner layer of  bone (trabecular bone). Although trabecular bone is expanded, the dense  outermost layer of bone (cortical bone) is thinner than normal. As a result, the  bones are fragile and fracture easily. The bone abnormalities in the legs  commonly cause knock knees (genu valgum) in affected individuals. html:p Other bone abnormalities can also occur in Pyle disease. Affected individuals  may have widened collar bones (clavicles), ribs, or bones in the fingers and  hands.

frequency1: Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is a rare condition, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 250,000 births worldwide. Type A appears to be much more common in some Algonkian Indian tribes in eastern Canada.
Description1: html:p Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes lactic acid  and other potentially toxic compounds to accumulate in the blood. High levels  of these substances can damage the body's organs and tissues, particularly in  the nervous system. html:p Researchers have identified at least three types of pyruvate carboxylase  deficiency, which are distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms.  Type A, which has been identified mostly in people from North America, has  severe symptoms that begin in infancy. Characteristic features include  and a buildup of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis).  Increased acidity in the blood can lead to vomiting, abdominal pain, extreme  tiredness (fatigue), muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. In some cases,  episodes of lactic acidosis are triggered by an illness or periods without food  (fasting). Children with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency type A typically  survive only into infancy or early childhood. html:p Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency type B has life-threatening signs and symptoms  that become apparent shortly after birth. This form of the condition has been  reported mostly in Europe, particularly France. Affected infants have severe  lactic acidosis, a buildup of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), and liver  failure. They experience neurological problems including  (), abnormal movements, , and coma. Infants with this form of  the condition usually survive for less than 3 months after birth. html:p A milder form of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, sometimes called type C, has  also been described. This type is characterized by slightly increased levels of  lactic acid in the blood and minimal signs and symptoms affecting the nervous  system.

Description1: html:p Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects red blood  cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. People with this disorder have  a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are  broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red  blood cells (anemia). Specifically, pyruvate kinase deficiency is a common cause  of a type of inherited hemolytic anemia called hereditary nonspherocytic  hemolytic anemia. In hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, the red blood  cells do not assume a spherical shape as they do in some other forms of  hemolytic anemia. html:p Chronic hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of  the eyes and skin (jaundice), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath  (dyspnea), and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). An enlarged spleen  (splenomegaly), an excess of iron in the blood, and small pebble-like deposits  in the gallbladder or bile ducts (gallstones) are also common in this disorder. html:p In people with pyruvate kinase deficiency, hemolytic anemia and associated  complications may range from mild to severe. Some affected individuals have few  or no symptoms. Severe cases can be life-threatening in infancy, and such  affected individuals may require regular blood transfusions to survive. The  symptoms of this disorder may get worse during an infection or pregnancy.

frequency1: Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is estimated to affect less than 1 per million people worldwide. Several dozen cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe insulin  resistance, a condition in which the body's tissues and organs do not respond  properly to the hormone insulin. Insulin normally helps regulate blood sugar  levels by controlling how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the  bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. In people with Rabson-Mendenhall  syndrome, insulin resistance impairs blood sugar regulation and ultimately leads  to a condition called diabetes mellitus, in which blood sugar levels can become  dangerously high. html:p Severe insulin resistance in people with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome affects the  . Affected individuals are unusually small  starting before birth, and infants experience failure to thrive, which means  they do not grow and gain weight at the expected rate. Additional features of  the condition that become apparent early in life include a lack of fatty tissue  under the skin (subcutaneous fat); wasting (atrophy) of muscles; dental  abnormalities; excessive body hair growth (hirsutism); multiple cysts on the  ovaries in females; and enlargement of the nipples, genitalia, kidneys, heart,  and other organs. Most affected individuals also have a skin condition called  acanthosis nigricans, in which the skin in body folds and creases becomes thick,  dark, and velvety. Distinctive facial features in people with Rabson-Mendenhall  syndrome include prominent, widely spaced eyes; a broad nose; and large,  low-set ears. html:p Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is one of a group of related conditions described as  inherited severe insulin resistance syndromes. These disorders, which also  include Donohue syndrome and type A insulin resistance syndrome, are considered  part of a spectrum. Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is intermediate in severity  between Donohue syndrome (which is usually fatal before age 2) and type A  insulin resistance syndrome (which is often not diagnosed until adolescence).  People with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome develop signs and symptoms early in life  and live into their teens or twenties. Death usually results from complications  related to diabetes mellitus, such as a toxic buildup of acids called ketones in  the body (diabetic ketoacidosis).

In individuals with RAPADILINO syndrome, osteosarcoma most often  develops during childhood or adolescence, and lymphoma typically develops in  young adulthood. html:p The condition name is an acronym for the characteristic features of the  disorder: RA for radial ray malformations, PA for patella and palate  abnormalities, DI for diarrhea and dislocated joints, LI for limb abnormalities  and little size, and NO for slender nose and normal intelligence. html:p The varied signs and symptoms of RAPADILINO syndrome overlap with features of  other disorders, namely Baller-Gerold syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.  These syndromes are also characterized by radial ray defects, skeletal  abnormalities, and . All of these conditions can be caused by  mutations in the same gene. Based on these similarities, researchers are  investigating whether Baller-Gerold syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, and  RAPADILINO syndrome are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with  overlapping signs and symptoms.

If a hydatidiform mole occurs once, it is  known a sporadic hydatidiform mole; if it happens again, the condition is known  as recurrent hydatidiform mole. html:p A hydatidiform mole often causes vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of the  pregnancy. In an ultrasound examination, the abnormal placenta appears as  numerous small sacs, often described as resembling a bunch of grapes. In some  cases, the ultrasound shows no fetus, umbilical cord, or amniotic sac (a  fluid-filled sac that normally surrounds the fetus). html:p Hydatidiform moles are not naturally discharged from the body and must be  surgically removed, typically by the end of the first trimester. After removal,  there is up to a 20 percent risk that any tissue left behind (persistent mole)  will continue to grow and become a cancerous tumor called an invasive mole. The  invasive mole can transform into a different form of cancer called gestational  choriocarcinoma that can spread (metastasize) to other tissues such as the  liver, lungs, or brain.

This disorder affects the retina, the  light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. Vision loss occurs as the  light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. The first sign of  retinitis pigmentosa is usually a loss of night vision, which often becomes  apparent in childhood. Over a period of years, the disease disrupts side  (peripheral) vision and may eventually lead to blindness. html:p Vision loss and anosmia are seen in almost everyone with Refsum disease, but  other signs and symptoms vary. About one-third of affected individuals are born  with bone abnormalities of the hands and feet. Features that appear later in  life can include progressive muscle weakness and wasting;  ; hearing loss; and dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis).

People with this  condition typically have  , which can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This serious  disease occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste  products from the body effectively. It has been estimated that approximately  ten percent of children with hypoplastic kidneys may have renal coloboma  syndrome. The kidney problems can affect one or both kidneys. html:p Additionally, people with renal coloboma syndrome may have a malformation in the  optic nerve, a structure that carries information from the eye to the brain.  Optic nerve malformations are sometimes associated with a gap or hole (coloboma)  in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). The vision  problems caused by these abnormalities can vary depending on the size and  location of the malformation. Some people have no visual problems, while others  may have severely impaired vision. html:p Less common features of renal coloboma syndrome include backflow of urine from  the bladder (vesicoureteral reflux), multiple kidney cysts, loose joints, and  mild hearing loss.

frequency1: The prevalence of renal hypouricemia is unknown; at least 150 affected <span style="background:#FFFF00;">individuals have been described in the scientific literature. This condition is</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">thought to be most prevalent in Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">although affected individuals have been found in Europe. Renal hypouricemia is</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">likely underdiagnosed because it does not cause any symptoms in many affected</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">individuals.</span>
Description1: html:p Renal hypouricemia is a kidney (renal) disorder that results in a reduced amount  of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a byproduct of certain normal chemical  reactions in the body. In the bloodstream it acts as an antioxidant, protecting  cells from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals.  However, having too much uric acid in the body is toxic, so excess uric acid is  removed from the body in urine. html:p People with renal hypouricemia have little to no uric acid in their blood; they  release an excessive amount of it in the urine. In many affected individuals,  renal hypouricemia causes no signs or symptoms. However, some people with this  condition develop kidney problems. After strenuous exercise, they can develop  exercise-induced acute kidney injury, which causes pain in their sides and lower  back as well as nausea and vomiting that can last several hours. html:p Because an excessive amount of uric acid passes through the kidneys to be  excreted in urine in people with renal hypouricemia, they have an increased risk  of developing kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) formed from uric acid crystals.  These uric acid stones can damage the kidneys and lead to episodes of blood in  the urine (hematuria). Rarely, people with renal hypouricemia develop  life-threatening kidney failure.

frequency1: Renal tubular acidosis with deafness is a rare disorder; its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Renal tubular acidosis with deafness is a disorder characterized by kidney  (renal) problems and hearing loss. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste  products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with this  disorder, the kidneys do not remove enough acidic compounds from the body.  Instead, the acids are absorbed back into the bloodstream, and the blood becomes  too acidic. This chemical imbalance, called metabolic acidosis, can result in a  range of signs and symptoms that vary in severity. Metabolic acidosis often  causes nausea, vomiting, and dehydration; affected infants tend to have problems  feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). Most children and adults with  renal tubular acidosis with deafness have , and many develop kidney  stones. html:p The metabolic acidosis that occurs in renal tubular acidosis with deafness may  also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children  and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain,  bowed legs, and difficulty walking. Rarely, people with renal tubular acidosis  with deafness have episodes of hypokalemic paralysis, a condition that causes  extreme muscle weakness associated with low levels of potassium in the blood  (hypokalemia). html:p In people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, hearing loss caused by  changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) usually begins between  childhood and young adulthood, and gradually gets worse. An inner ear  abnormality affecting both ears occurs in most people with this disorder. This  feature, which is called enlarged vestibular aqueduct, can be seen with medical  imaging. The vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal that runs from the inner ear  into the temporal bone of the skull and toward the brain. The relationship  between enlarged vestibular aqueduct and hearing loss is unclear. In renal  tubular acidosis with deafness, enlarged vestibular aqueduct typically occurs in  individuals whose hearing loss begins in childhood.

frequency1: Renal tubular dysgenesis is a rare disorder, but its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Renal tubular dysgenesis is a severe kidney disorder characterized by abnormal  development of the kidneys before birth. In particular, kidney structures called  proximal tubules are absent or underdeveloped. These structures help to  reabsorb needed nutrients, water, and other materials into the blood and excrete  everything else into the urine. Without functional proximal tubules, the  kidneys cannot produce urine (a condition called anuria). html:p Fetal urine is the major component of the fluid that surrounds the fetus  (amniotic fluid), and anuria leads to decreased amniotic fluid levels  (oligohydramnios). Amniotic fluid helps cushion and protect the fetus and plays  a role in the development of many organs, including the lungs. Oligohydramnios  causes a set of abnormalities called the Potter sequence, which includes  distinctive facial features such as a flattened nose and large, low-set ears;  excess skin; inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet); and underdeveloped  lungs. html:p Renal tubular dysgenesis also causes severe . In  addition,  is abnormal in some affected  individuals, causing a large space between the bones of the skull (fontanelles). html:p As a result of the serious health problems caused by renal tubular dysgenesis,  affected individuals usually die before birth, are stillborn, or die soon after  birth from respiratory failure. Rarely, with treatment, affected individuals  survive into childhood. Their blood pressure usually normalizes, but they  quickly develop chronic kidney disease, which is characterized by reduced kidney  function that worsens over time.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Restless legs syndrome is a neurological condition that causes an irresistible</span>  urge to move the legs. The movement is triggered by strange or uncomfortable  feelings, often described as crawling, pulling, or itching, deep within both  legs. The feelings usually occur while the affected person is sitting or lying  down and are worse at night. Movement, such as kicking, stretching, rubbing, or  pacing, make the discomfort go away, at least temporarily. The unpleasant  feelings and the resulting need to move the legs often make it difficult for an  affected person to fall asleep or stay asleep. html:p The signs and symptoms of restless legs syndrome range from mild to severe;  people with mild cases may experience symptoms a few times a month, while those  with more severe cases may have symptoms every night. In severe cases, the  uncomfortable feelings can affect the arms or other parts of the body in  addition to the legs. html:p Many people with restless legs syndrome also experience uncontrollable,  repetitive leg movements that occur while they are sleeping or while relaxed or  drowsy. When these movements occur during sleep, they are called periodic limb  movements of sleep (PLMS); when they occur while a person is awake, they are  called periodic limb movements of wakefulness (PLMW). It is unclear whether PLMS  and PLMW are features of restless legs syndrome itself or represent similar,  but separate, conditions. html:p Restless legs syndrome and PLMS can affect the quality and amount of sleep. As a  result of these conditions, affected individuals may have difficulty  concentrating during the day, and some develop mood swings, , or other  health problems. html:p Researchers have described early-onset and late-onset forms of restless legs  syndrome. The early-onset form begins before age 45, and sometimes as early as  childhood. The signs and symptoms of this form usually worsen slowly with time.  The late-onset form begins after age 45, and its signs and symptoms tend to  worsen more rapidly.

frequency1: RAMSVPS is a rare disorder. Only a small number of affected individuals and families, all from Saudi Arabia, have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis (RAMSVPS) is  a disorder that affects blood vessels in the eyes and heart. The condition  generally becomes apparent in infancy or childhood. html:p RAMSVPS damages the arteries in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the  eye (the retina). These arteries gradually develop multiple small bulges called  beading. Eventually, larger bulges in the blood vessel walls (macroaneurysms)  occur. These macroaneurysms can tear (rupture), leading to bleeding that can  spread into other areas of the eye and cause vision loss. html:p People with RAMSVPS also have a heart condition called supravalvular pulmonic  stenosis. Pulmonic stenosis is a narrowing that affects the pulmonic valve  between the heart and the lungs. The term"supravalvular"means that the  narrowing occurs just above the valve, in a blood vessel called the pulmonary  artery. Supravalvular pulmonic stenosis impairs blood flow into the lungs, where  blood normally picks up oxygen for distribution to cells and tissues throughout  the body. As a result, less oxygen is carried through the bloodstream, leading  to signs and symptoms that include shortness of breath; a rapid heartbeat;  fatigue; and swelling in the face, feet, or abdomen.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of related eye disorders that cause progressive</span>  vision loss. These disorders affect the retina, which is the layer of  light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In people with retinitis  pigmentosa, vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina  gradually deteriorate. html:p The first sign of retinitis pigmentosa is usually a loss of night vision, which  becomes apparent in childhood. Problems with night vision can make it difficult  to navigate in low light. Later, the disease causes blind spots to develop in  the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots merge to produce  tunnel vision. The disease progresses over years or decades to affect central  vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and  recognizing faces. In adulthood, many people with retinitis pigmentosa become  legally blind. html:p The signs and symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are most often limited to vision  loss. When the disorder occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic.  Researchers have identified several major types of nonsyndromic retinitis  pigmentosa, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance:  autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. html:p Less commonly, retinitis pigmentosa occurs as part of syndromes that affect  other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the disease are described  as syndromic. The most common form of syndromic retinitis pigmentosa is Usher  syndrome, which is characterized by the combination of vision loss and hearing  loss beginning early in life. Retinitis pigmentosa is also a feature of several  other genetic syndromes, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome; Refsum disease; and  neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP).

GHR-webpage1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/retinoblastoma</span>
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Retinoblastoma is diagnosed in 250 to 350 children per year in the United</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">States. It accounts for about 4 percent of all cancers in children younger than</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">15 years.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that usually develops in early</span>  childhood, typically before the age of 5. This form of cancer develops in the  retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye  that detects light and color. html:p In children with retinoblastoma, the disease often affects only one eye.  However, one out of three children with retinoblastoma develops cancer in both  eyes. The most common first sign of retinoblastoma is a visible whiteness in the  pupil called"cat's eye reflex"or leukocoria. This unusual whiteness is  particularly noticeable in dim light or in photographs taken with a flash. Other  signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include crossed eyes or eyes that do not  point in the same direction (strabismus), which can cause squinting; a change in  the color of the colored part of the eye (iris); redness, soreness, or swelling  of the eyelids; and blindness or poor vision in the affected eye or eyes. html:p Retinoblastoma is often curable when it is diagnosed early. However, if it is  not treated promptly, this cancer can spread beyond the eye to other parts of  the body. This advanced form of retinoblastoma can be life-threatening. html:p When retinoblastoma is associated with a genetic change (mutation) that occurs  in all of the body's cells, it is known as hereditary (or germinal)  retinoblastoma. People with this form of retinoblastoma typically develop cancer  in both eyes and also have an increased risk of developing several other  cancers outside the eye. Specifically, they are more likely to develop a cancer  of the pineal gland in the brain (pineoblastoma), a type of bone cancer known as  osteosarcoma, cancers of soft tissues (such as muscle) called soft tissue  sarcomas, and an  form of skin cancer called melanoma.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/retroperitoneal-fibrosis
frequency1: Retroperitoneal fibrosis occurs in 1 in 200,000 to 500,000 people per year. <span style="background:#FFFF00;">The disorder occurs approximately twice as often in men as it does in women,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">but the reason for this difference is unclear.</span>
Description1: html:p Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a disorder in which inflammation and extensive scar  tissue (fibrosis) occur in the back of the abdominal cavity, behind (retro-) the  membrane that surrounds the organs of the digestive system (the peritoneum).  This area is known as the retroperitoneal space. Retroperitoneal fibrosis can  occur at any age but appears most frequently between the ages of 40 and 60. html:p The inflamed tissue characteristic of retroperitoneal fibrosis typically causes  gradually increasing pain in the lower abdomen, back, or side. Other symptoms  arise from blockage of blood flow to and from various parts of the lower body,  due to the . The fibrosis usually  develops first around the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that  distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Additional blood  vessels including the inferior vena cava, which returns blood from the lower  part of the body to the heart, may also be involved. Obstruction of blood flow  to and from the legs can result in pain, changes in color, and swelling in these  limbs. Impairment of blood flow in the intestines may lead to death (necrosis)  of intestinal tissue, severe pain, and excessive bleeding (hemorrhage). In men,  reduced blood flow back toward the heart (venous flow) may cause swelling of the  scrotum. html:p Because the kidneys are located in the retroperitoneal space, retroperitoneal  fibrosis may result in blockage of the ureters, which are tubes that carry urine  from each kidney to the bladder. Such blockages can lead to decreased or absent  urine flow and kidney failure. When the kidneys fail, toxic substances build up  in the blood and tissues, leading to nausea, vomiting, weight loss, itching, a  low number of red blood cells (anemia), and changes in brain function.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Rett syndrome is a brain disorder that occurs almost exclusively in girls. The</span>  most common form of the condition is known as classic Rett syndrome. After  birth, girls with classic Rett syndrome have 6 to 18 months of apparently normal  development before developing severe problems with  and ,  , coordination, and other brain functions. Early in childhood, affected  girls lose purposeful use of their hands and begin making repeated hand  wringing, washing, or clapping motions. They tend to grow more slowly than other  children and have a small head size (microcephaly). Other signs and symptoms  that can develop include breathing abnormalities, , an abnormal  side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and sleep disturbances. html:p Researchers have described several variant or atypical forms of Rett syndrome,  which can be milder or more severe than the classic form.

The</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">disease is two to three times more common in women than in men, which may be</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">related to hormonal factors.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that causes chronic abnormal inflammation,</span>  primarily affecting the joints. The most common signs and symptoms are pain,  swelling, and stiffness of the joints. Small joints in the hands and feet are  involved most often, although larger joints (such as the shoulders, hips, and  knees) may become involved later in the disease. Joints are typically affected  in a symmetrical pattern; for example, if joints in the hand are affected, both  hands tend to be involved. People with rheumatoid arthritis often report that  their joint pain and stiffness is worse when getting out of bed in the morning  or after a long rest. html:p Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation of other tissues and organs,  including the eyes, lungs, and blood vessels. Additional signs and symptoms of  the condition can include a loss of energy, a low fever, weight loss, and a  shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Some affected individuals develop  rheumatoid nodules, which are firm lumps of noncancerous tissue that can grow  under the skin and elsewhere in the body. html:p The signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually appear in mid- to late  adulthood. Many affected people have episodes of symptoms (flares) followed by  periods with no symptoms (remissions) for the rest of their lives. In severe  cases, affected individuals have continuous health problems related to the  disease for many years. The abnormal inflammation can lead to severe joint  damage, which limits movement and can cause significant disability.

Description1: html:p Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata is a condition that impairs the normal  development of many parts of the body. The major features of this disorder  include s   html:p Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata is characterized by shortening of the bones  in the upper arms and thighs (rhizomelia). Affected individuals also have a  specific bone abnormality called chondrodysplasia punctata, which affects the  growth of the long bones and can be seen on x-rays. People with rhizomelic  chondrodysplasia punctata often  that  make the joints stiff and painful. html:p Distinctive facial features are also seen with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia  punctata. These include a prominent forehead, widely set eyes (hypertelorism), a  , a small nose  with upturned nostrils, and full cheeks. Additionally, almost all affected  individuals have clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts). The cataracts  are apparent at birth (congenital) or develop in early infancy. html:p Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata is associated with significantly  . Most children with this  condition do not achieve  , feeding themselves, or speaking in phrases. Affected infants grow much  more slowly than other children their age, and many also have .  Recurrent respiratory infections and life-threatening breathing problems are  common. Because of their severe health problems, most people with rhizomelic  chondrodysplasia punctata survive only into childhood. It is rare for affected  children to live past age 10. However, a few individuals with milder features of  the condition have lived into early adulthood. html:p Researchers have described three types of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata:  type 1 (RCDP1), type 2 (RCDP2), and type 3 (RCDP3). The types have similar  features and are distinguished by their genetic cause.

Name1: Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/riboflavin-transporter-deficiency-neuronopathy
frequency1: Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy is a rare condition. Approximately 100 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy is a disorder that affects nerve  cells (neurons). Affected individuals typically have hearing loss caused by  nerve damage in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) and signs of damage  to other nerves. html:p In addition to nerves in the inner ear, riboflavin transporter deficiency  neuronopathy involves nerves found in the part of the brain that is connected to  the spinal cord (the brainstem), specifically in a region of the brainstem  known as the pontobulbar region. Damage to these nerves causes paralysis of the  muscles controlled by them, a condition called pontobulbar palsy. Nerves in the  pontobulbar region help control several voluntary muscle activities, including  breathing, speaking, and moving the limbs. As a result of pontobulbar palsy,  people with riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy can have breathing  problems; slurred ; and muscle weakness in the face, neck, shoulders, and  limbs. Affected individuals can also have and  exaggerated reflexes. html:p The age at which riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy begins varies  from infancy to young adulthood. When the condition begins in infancy, the first  symptom is often breathing problems caused by nerve damage, which can be  life-threatening. When the condition begins in children or young adults,  sensorineural hearing loss usually occurs first, followed by signs of  pontobulbar palsy. html:p If not treated, the signs and symptoms of riboflavin transporter deficiency  neuronopathy worsen over time. Severe breathing problems and respiratory  infections are the usual cause of death in people with this condition. Without  treatment, affected infants typically survive less than one year. However, those  who develop the condition after age 4 often survive more than 10 years. html:p Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy encompasses two conditions that  were once considered distinct disorders: Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome  (BVVLS) and Fazio-Londe disease. The two conditions have similar signs and  symptoms, but Fazio-Londe disease does not include sensorineural hearing loss.  Because these two conditions share a genetic cause and have overlapping  features, researchers determined that they are forms of a single disorder.

Description1: html:p Rippling muscle disease is a condition in which the muscles are unusually  sensitive to movement or pressure (irritable). The muscles near the center of  the body (proximal muscles) are most affected, especially the thighs. In most  people with this condition, stretching the muscle causes visible ripples to  spread across the muscle, lasting 5 to 20 seconds. A bump or other sudden impact  on the muscle causes it to bunch up (percussion-induced muscle mounding) or  exhibit repetitive tensing (percussion-induced rapid contraction). The rapid  contractions can continue for up to 30 seconds and may be painful. html:p People with rippling muscle disease may have overgrowth (hypertrophy) of some  muscles, especially in the calf. Some affected individuals have an abnormal  pattern of walking (gait), such as walking on tiptoe. They may experience  fatigue, cramps, or muscle stiffness, especially after exercise or in cold  temperatures. html:p The age of onset of rippling muscle disease varies widely, but it often begins  in late childhood or adolescence. Rippling muscles may also occur as a feature  of other muscle disorders such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.

However, only about a quarter of these individuals have been confirmed to have the same genetic change that causes RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy. Researchers suggest that additional genetic changes or other causes may also result in the same pattern of signs and symptoms (phenotype).
Description1: html:p RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy is a disorder that affects the brain.  People with RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy have neurological problems  that become apparent during infancy; the problems generally do not worsen over  time (progress). Most affected individuals have severe  disability;  ; and a delay in developing motor skills such as  sitting, crawling, and walking. Some do not learn to walk, and most do not  develop the ability to speak. Other neurological features that can occur in  RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy include hearing loss caused by  abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness), , involuntary  writhing movements of the hands (athetosis),  , and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). In addition to the  neurological problems associated with this disorder, some affected individuals  have unusual facial features sometimes described as a"doll-like face." html:p The neurological problems in this disorder are caused by abnormalities in the  brain. People with this condition have leukoencephalopathy, an abnormality of  the brain's white matter that can be detected with medical imaging. White matter  consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin  insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. In  people with RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy, myelin is not made in  sufficient amounts during development, leading to  . In addition, individuals with RNAse  T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy may have cysts in regions of the brain called  the temporal lobes and enlargement of the fluid-filled cavities (ventricles)  near the center of the brain. The white matter lesions are primarily  concentrated around the cysts and the ventricles. An abnormally small head and  brain size (microcephaly) often occurs in this disorder.

This form of the condition has been identified in families from several countries, including Turkey, Oman, Pakistan, and Brazil.Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome has been diagnosed in fewer than 50 families; about 10 of these families have had the osteosclerotic form.
Description1: html:p Robinow syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the development of many parts  of the body, particularly the bones. Researchers have identified two major types  of Robinow syndrome. The types are distinguished by the severity of their signs  and symptoms and by their pattern of inheritance, autosomal recessive or  autosomal dominant. html:p Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome is characterized by skeletal abnormalities  including shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs, particularly the  forearms; abnormally short fingers and toes (brachydactyly); wedge-shaped spinal  bones (hemivertebrae) leading to an abnormal curvature of the spine  (kyphoscoliosis); fused or missing ribs; and . Affected individuals  also have distinctive facial features, such as a broad forehead, prominent and  widely spaced eyes, a short nose with an upturned tip, a wide nasal bridge, and  a broad and triangle-shaped mouth. Together, these facial features are sometimes  described as"fetal facies"because they resemble the facial structure of a  developing fetus. Other common features of autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome  include underdeveloped genitalia in both males and females, and dental problems  such as crowded teeth and overgrowth of the gums. Kidney and s are  also possible. Occurs in 10 to 15 percent of people with  this condition, although intelligence is usually normal. html:p Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome has signs and symptoms that are similar to,  but tend to be milder than, those of the autosomal recessive form. Abnormalities  of the spine and ribs are rarely seen in the autosomal dominant form, and  is less pronounced. A variant form of autosomal dominant Robinow  syndrome features increased bone mineral density (osteosclerosis) in addition to  the signs and symptoms listed above. This variant is called the osteosclerotic  form of Robinow syndrome.

Description1: html:p Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is a rare condition that affects many parts of the  body, especially the skin. People with this condition typically develop redness  on the cheeks between ages 3 months and 6 months. Over time the rash spreads to  the arms and legs, causing patchy changes in skin coloring, areas of thinning  skin (atrophy), and small clusters of blood vessels just under the skin  (telangiectases). These skin problems persist for life and are collectively  known as poikiloderma. html:p Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is also characterized by sparse hair, eyebrows, and  eyelashes; and ; abnormalities of the teeth and nails;  and gastrointestinal problems in infancy, such as chronic diarrhea and vomiting.  Some affected children develop a clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract),  which affects vision. Many people with this disorder have skeletal abnormalities  including absent or malformed bones, fused bones, and low bone mineral density  . Some of these abnormalities affect the development  of bones in the forearms and the thumbs, and are known as radial ray  malformations. html:p People with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome have an increased risk of developing  cancer, particularly a form of bone cancer called osteosarcoma.

Babies with this condition have a low birth weight and often  fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Head  growth is normal, however, so the head may appear unusually large compared to  the rest of the body. Affected children are thin and have poor appetites, and  some develop recurrent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) as a result of  feeding difficulties. Adults with Russell-Silver syndrome are short; the  average height for affected men is about 151 centimeters (4 feet, 11 inches) and  the average height for affected women is about 140 centimeters (4 feet, 7  inches). html:p Many children with Russell-Silver syndrome have a small, triangular face with  distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, a narrow chin, a  small jaw, and downturned corners of the mouth. Other features of this disorder  can include an unusual curving of the fifth finger (clinodactyly), asymmetric or  uneven growth of some parts of the body, and digestive system abnormalities.

Description1: html:p Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the premature  fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the  skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. html:p Most people with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have prematurely fused skull bones  along the coronal suture, the growth line that goes over the head from ear to  ear. Other parts of the skull may be malformed as well. These changes can  result in an abnormally shaped head, a high forehead, a low frontal hairline,  droopy eyelids (ptosis), widely spaced eyes, and a broad nasal bridge. One side  of the face may appear noticeably different from the other (facial asymmetry).  Most people with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome also have small, unusually shaped  ears. html:p The signs and symptoms of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome vary widely, even among  affected individuals in the same family. This condition can cause mild  abnormalities of the hands and feet, such as fusion of the skin between the  second and third fingers on each hand and a broad or duplicated first (big) toe.  have been reported, although most  people with this condition are of normal intelligence. Less common signs and  symptoms of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome include , abnormalities of the  bones of the spine (the vertebra), hearing loss, and s. html:p Robinow-Sorauf syndrome is a condition with features similar to those of  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, including craniosynostosis and broad or duplicated  great toes.

Description1: html:p Sandhoff disease is a rare inherited disorder that progressively destroys nerve  cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. html:p The most common and severe form of Sandhoff disease becomes apparent in infancy.  Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6  months, when their  and muscles used for movement weaken.  Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling.  They also develop an exaggerated startle reaction to loud noises. As the disease  progresses, children with Sandhoff disease experience , vision and  hearing loss,  disability, and paralysis. An eye abnormality called  a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is  characteristic of this disorder. Some affected children also have enlarged  organs (organomegaly) or bone abnormalities. Children with the severe infantile  form of Sandhoff disease usually live only into early childhood. html:p Other forms of Sandhoff disease are very rare. Signs and symptoms can begin in  childhood, adolescence, or adulthood and are usually milder than those seen with  the infantile form. Characteristic features include muscle weakness,  and other problems with movement,  problems,  and mental illness.

Description1: html:p Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia is a condition characterized by ,  kidney disease, and a weakened immune system. In people with this condition,  is caused by flattened spinal bones (vertebrae), resulting in a  shortened neck and trunk. Adult height is typically between 3 and 5 feet.  Kidney (renal) disease often leads to life-threatening renal failure and  end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Affected individuals also have a shortage of  certain immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances  and defend the body against infection. A shortage of T cells causes a person  to be more susceptible to illness. html:p Other features frequently seen in people with this condition include an  exaggerated curvature of the lower back (lordosis); darkened patches of skin  (hyperpigmentation), typically on the chest and back; and a broad nasal bridge  with a rounded tip of the nose. html:p Less common signs and symptoms of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia include an  accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the  arteries (atherosclerosis), reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia),  migraine-like headaches, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism),  decreased numbers of white blood cells (lymphopenia), underdeveloped hip bones  (hypoplastic pelvis), abnormally small head size (microcephaly), a lack of sperm  (azoospermia) in males, and irregular menstruation in females. html:p In severe cases, many signs of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia can be present  at birth.

Most schwannomas are isolated, meaning that an individual develops only a single tumor. It is rarer to have multiple schwannomas, as occurs in schwannomatosis.
Description1: html:p Schwannomatosis is a disorder characterized by multiple noncancerous (benign)  tumors called schwannomas, which are a type of tumor that grows on nerves.  Schwannomas develop when Schwann cells, which are specialized cells that  normally form an insulating layer around the nerve, grow uncontrollably to form  a tumor. html:p The signs and symptoms of schwannomatosis usually appear in early adulthood. The  most common symptom is long-lasting (chronic) pain, which can affect any part  of the body. In some cases, the pain is felt in areas where there are no known  tumors. The pain associated with this condition ranges from mild to severe and  can be difficult to manage. Other signs and symptoms that can occur with  schwannomatosis depend on the location of the tumors and which nerves are  affected. These problems include numbness, weakness, tingling, and headaches.  The life expectancy of people with schwannomatosis is normal. html:p Schwannomatosis is usually considered to be a form of neurofibromatosis, which  is a group of disorders characterized by the growth of tumors in the nervous  system. The other two recognized forms of neurofibromatosis are  neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2. The features of  schwannomatosis can be very similar to those of neurofibromatosis type 2.  However, schwannomatosis almost never includes inner ear tumors called  vestibular schwannomas, which are a hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2.  Additional features of the other forms of neurofibromatosis, including the  development of other types of tumors, are much less common in schwannomatosis.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/schwartz-jampel-syndrome
frequency1: Schwartz-Jampel syndrome appears to be a rare condition. About 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Schwartz-Jampel syndrome is a rare condition characterized by permanent muscle  stiffness (myotonia) and bone abnormalities known as chondrodysplasia. The signs  and symptoms of this condition become apparent sometime after birth, usually in  early childhood. Either muscle stiffness or chondrodysplasia can appear first.  The muscle and bone abnormalities worsen in childhood, although most affected  individuals have a normal lifespan. The specific features of Schwartz-Jampel  syndrome vary widely. html:p Myotonia involves continuous tensing (contraction) of muscles used for movement  (skeletal muscles) throughout the body. This sustained muscle contraction causes  stiffness that interferes with eating, sitting, walking, and other movements.  Sustained contraction of muscles in the face leads to a fixed,"mask-like"  facial expression with narrow eye openings (blepharophimosis) and pursed lips.  This facial appearance is very specific to Schwartz-Jampel syndrome. Affected  individuals may also be nearsighted and experience abnormal blinking or spasms  of the eyelids (blepharospasm). html:p Chondrodysplasia affects the, particularly the long  bones in the arms and legs and the bones of the hips. These bones are shortened  and unusually wide at the ends, so affected individuals have . The  long bones may also be abnormally curved (bowed). Other bone abnormalities  associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome include a protruding chest (pectus  carinatum), abnormal curvature of the spine, flattened bones of the spine  (platyspondyly), and  that further  restrict movement. html:p Researchers originally described two types of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome. Type 1  has the signs and symptoms described above, while type 2 has more severe bone  abnormalities and other health problems and is usually life-threatening in early  infancy. Researchers have since discovered that the condition they thought was  Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 is actually part of another disorder,  Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome, which is caused by mutations in a different gene. They  have recommended that the designation Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 no longer  be used.

frequency1: Senior-Løken syndrome is a rare disorder, with an estimated prevalence of about 1 in 1 million people worldwide. Only a few families with the condition have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Senior-Løken syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the combination of two  specific features: a kidney condition called nephronophthisis and an eye  condition known as Leber congenital amaurosis. html:p Nephronophthisis causes fluid-filled cysts to develop in the kidneys beginning  in childhood. These cysts impair kidney function, initially causing increased  urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), general weakness,  and extreme tiredness (fatigue). Nephronophthisis leads to end-stage renal  disease (ESRD) later in childhood or in adolescence. ESRD is a life-threatening  failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to  filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. html:p Leber congenital amaurosis primarily affects the retina, which is the  specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. This  condition causes vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light  (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme  farsightedness (hyperopia). Some people with Senior-Løken syndrome develop the  signs of Leber congenital amaurosis within the first few years of life, while  others do not develop vision problems until later in childhood.

Description1: html:p Sézary syndrome is an  form of a type of blood cancer called cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas occur when certain white blood  cells, called T cells, become cancerous; these cancers characteristically affect  the skin, causing different types of skin lesions. In Sézary syndrome, the  cancerous T cells, called Sézary cells, are present in the blood, skin, and  lymph nodes. A characteristic of Sézary cells is an abnormally shaped nucleus,  described as cerebriform. html:p People with Sézary syndrome develop a red, severely itchy rash (erythroderma)  that covers large portions of their body. Sézary cells are found in the rash.  However, the skin cells themselves are not cancerous; the skin problems result  when Sézary cells move from the blood into the skin. People with Sézary syndrome  also have enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Other common signs and  symptoms of this condition include hair loss (alopecia), skin swelling (edema),  thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar  keratoderma), abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, and lower eyelids  that turn outward (ectropion). Some people with Sézary syndrome are less able to  control their body temperature than people without the condition. html:p The cancerous T cells can spread to other organs in the body, including the  lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. In addition, affected individuals  have an increased risk of developing another lymphoma or other type of cancer. html:p Sézary syndrome most often occurs in adults over age 60 and usually progresses  rapidly; historically, affected individuals survived an average of 2 to 4 years  after development of the condition, although survival has improved with newer  treatments. html:p Although Sézary syndrome is sometimes referred to as a variant of another  cutaneous T-cell lymphoma called mycosis fungoides, these two cancers are  generally considered separate conditions.

Description1: html:p Sheldon-Hall syndrome, also known as distal arthrogryposis type 2B, is a  disorder characterized bythat restrict  movement in the hands and feet. The term"arthrogryposis"comes from the Greek  words for joint (arthro-) and crooked or hooked (gryposis)."Distal"refers to  areas of the body away from the center. The characteristic features of this  condition include permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), overlapping  fingers, and a hand deformity called ulnar deviation in which all of the  fingers are angled outward toward the fifth (pinky) finger. Inward- and  upward-turning feet (a condition called clubfoot) is also commonly seen in  Sheldon-Hall syndrome. The specific hand and foot abnormalities vary among  affected individuals; the abnormalities are present at birth and generally do  not get worse over time. html:p People with Sheldon-Hall syndrome also usually have distinctive facial features,  which include a triangular face; outside corners of the eyes that point  downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures); deep folds in the skin between the  nose and lips (nasolabial folds); and a small mouth with a high, arched roof of  the mouth (palate). Other features that may occur in Sheldon-Hall syndrome  include extra folds of skin on the neck (webbed neck) and . html:p Sheldon-Hall syndrome does not usually affect other parts of the body, and  intelligence and life expectancy are normal in this disorder.

Description1: html:p Short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency (also known as  2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) is a rare disorder in which the  body is unable to process proteins properly. Normally, the body breaks down  proteins from food into smaller parts called amino acids. Amino acids can be  further processed to provide energy for the body. People with SBCAD deficiency  cannot process a particular amino acid called isoleucine. html:p Most cases of SBCAD deficiency are detected shortly after birth by newborn  screening, which identifies abnormal levels of certain compounds in the blood.  In individuals with this condition, a compound called 2-methylbutyryl carnitine  is elevated in the blood and another called 2-methylbutyrylglycine is elevated  in the urine (2-methylbutyrylglycinuria). html:p Most people with SBCAD deficiency have no health problems related to the  disorder. A small percentage of affected individuals develop signs and symptoms  of the condition, which can begin soon after birth or later in childhood. The  initial symptoms often include poor feeding, lack of energy (lethargy),  vomiting, and irritability. These symptoms sometimes progress to serious health  problems such as difficulty breathing, , and coma. Additional problems  can include , vision impairment,  disabilities, muscle  weakness, and delays in motor skills such as standing and walking. html:p It is unclear why some people with SBCAD deficiency develop health problems and  others do not. Doctors suggest that in some cases, signs and symptoms may be  triggered by infections, prolonged periods without food (fasting), or an  increased amount of protein-rich foods in the diet.

frequency1: Short QT syndrome appears to be rare. At least 70 cases have been identified worldwide since the condition was discovered in 2000. However, the condition may be underdiagnosed because some affected individuals never experience symptoms.
Description1: html:p Short QT syndrome is a condition that can cause a disruption of the heart's  normal rhythm (arrhythmia). In people with this condition, the heart (cardiac)  muscle takes less time than usual to recharge between beats. The term"short QT"  refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an  electrocardiogram (EKG), which is a test used to measure the electrical activity  of the heart. In people with this condition, the part of the heartbeat known as  the QT interval is abnormally short. html:p If untreated, the arrhythmia associated with short QT syndrome can lead to a  variety of signs and symptoms, from dizziness and fainting (syncope) to cardiac  arrest and sudden death. These signs and symptoms can occur any time from early  infancy to old age. This condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death  syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of unexplained death in babies younger  than 1 year.

Description1: and teething delay, commonly known by the acronym SHORT syndrome, is a rare  disorder that affects many parts of the body. html:p Most people with SHORT syndrome are small at birth and gain weight slowly in  childhood. Affected adults tend to have  compared with others in  their family. Many have a lack of fatty tissue under the skin (lipoatrophy),  primarily in the face, arms, and chest. This lack of fat, together with thin,  wrinkled skin and veins visible beneath the skin, makes affected individuals  look older than their biological age. This appearance of premature aging is  sometimes described as progeroid. html:p Most people with SHORT syndrome have distinctive facial features. These include  a triangular face shape with a prominent forehead and deep-set eyes (ocular  ), thin nostrils, a downturned mouth, and a small chin. Eye  abnormalities are common in affected individuals, particularly Rieger anomaly,  which affects structures at the front of the eye. Rieger anomaly can be  associated with increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) and vision loss. Some  people with SHORT syndrome also have dental abnormalities such as delayed  appearance (eruption) of teeth in early childhood, small teeth, fewer teeth than  normal (hypodontia), and a lack of protective covering (enamel) on the surface  of the teeth. html:p Other signs and symptoms that have been reported in people with SHORT syndrome  include immune system abnormalities, a kidney disorder known as  nephrocalcinosis, hearing loss, loose (hyperextensible) joints, and a soft  out-pouching in the lower abdomen called an inguinal hernia. A few affected  individuals have developed problems with blood sugar regulation including  insulin resistance and diabetes.

It is difficult to identify the number of affected individuals, because some cases diagnosed as Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome may instead be Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome, which have overlapping signs and symptoms.
Description1: html:p Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body.  Affected individuals have a combination of distinctive facial features and  skeletal and neurological abnormalities. html:p A common feature in people with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is  craniosynostosis, which is the premature fusion of certain skull bones. This  early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally. Affected individuals can  also have distinctive facial features, including a long, narrow head; widely  spaced eyes (hypertelorism); protruding eyes (exophthalmos); outside corners of  the eyes that point downward (downslanting palpebral fissures); a high, narrow  palate; a small lower jaw (micrognathia); and low-set ears that are rotated  backward. html:p People with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome are often said to have a marfanoid  habitus, because their bodies resemble those of people with a genetic condition  called Marfan syndrome. For example, they may have long, slender fingers  (arachnodactyly), unusually long limbs, a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or  protruding chest (pectus carinatum), and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of  the spine (scoliosis). People with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome can have other  skeletal abnormalities, such as one or more fingers that are permanently bent  (camptodactyly) and an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). html:p People with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome often have   html:p Other common features of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome include heart or brain  abnormalities,  () in infancy, and a soft out-pouching  around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). html:p Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome has signs and symptoms similar to those of Marfan  syndrome and another genetic condition called Loeys-Dietz syndrome. However,  disability is more likely to occur in Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome  than in the other two conditions. In addition, heart abnormalities are more  common and usually more severe in Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Researchers are not sure how common Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is. Several</span> hundred cases have been reported in scientific studies.
Description1: html:p Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is an inherited condition that affects many parts of  the body, particularly the bone marrow, pancreas, and skeletal system. html:p The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. These include  red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues; white blood cells,  which fight infection; and platelets, which are blood cell fragments that are  necessary for normal blood clotting. In Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, the bone  marrow malfunctions and does not make some or all types of white blood cells. A  shortage of neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell, causes a  condition called neutropenia. Most people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome have  at least occasional episodes of neutropenia, which makes them more vulnerable to  infections such as pneumonia, recurrent ear infections (otitis media), and skin  infections. Less commonly, bone marrow abnormalities lead to a shortage of red  blood cells (anemia), which causes fatigue and weakness, or a reduction in the  amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can result in easy bruising and  abnormal bleeding. html:p People with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome have an increased risk of several serious  complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow. Specifically, they  have a higher-than-average chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  and aplastic anemia, which are disorders that affect blood cell production, and  a cancer of blood-forming tissue known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). html:p Shwachman-Diamond syndrome also affects the pancreas, which is an organ that  plays an essential role in digestion. One of this organ's main functions is to  produce enzymes that help break down and use the nutrients from food. In most  infants with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, the pancreas does not produce enough of  these enzymes. This condition is known as pancreatic insufficiency. Infants  with pancreatic insufficiency have trouble digesting food and absorbing  nutrients that are needed for . As a result, they often have fatty,  foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea); are slow to grow and gain weight (failure to  thrive); and experience malnutrition. Pancreatic insufficiency often improves  with age in people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. html:p Skeletal abnormalities are another common feature of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.  Many affected individuals have problems with bone formation and growth, most  often affecting the hips and knees. Low bone density is also frequently  associated with this condition. Some infants are born with a narrow rib cage  and short ribs, which can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. The  combination of skeletal abnormalities and results in  in most people with this disorder. html:p The complications of this condition can affect several other parts of the body,  including the liver, heart, endocrine system (which produces hormones), eyes,  teeth, and skin.

Description1: html:p Sialidosis is a severe inherited disorder that affects many organs and tissues,  including the nervous system. This disorder is divided into two types, which are  distinguished by the age at which symptoms appear and the severity of features. html:p Sialidosis type I, also referred to as cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome, is  the less severe form of this condition. People with type I develop signs and  symptoms of sialidosis in their teens or twenties. Initially, affected  individuals experience problems walking (gait disturbance) and/or a loss of  sharp vision (reduced visual acuity). Individuals with sialidosis type I also  experience muscle twitches (myoclonus), difficulty s  ,, and . The myoclonus worsens over time, causing  difficulty sitting, standing, or walking. People with sialidosis type I  eventually require wheelchair assistance. Affected individuals have progressive  vision problems, including impaired color vision or night blindness. An eye  abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye  examination, is characteristic of this disorder. Sialidosis type I does not  affect intelligence or life expectancy. html:p Sialidosis type II, the more severe type of the disorder, is further divided  into congenital, infantile, and juvenile forms. The features of congenital  sialidosis type II can develop before birth. This form of sialidosis is  associated with an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites)  or widespread swelling before birth caused by fluid accumulation (hydrops  fetalis). Affected infants may also have an  , , and  distinctive facial features that are often described as"coarse."As a result  of these serious health problems, individuals with congenital sialidosis type II  usually are stillborn or die soon after birth. html:p Infantile sialidosis type II shares some features with the congenital form,  although the signs and symptoms are slightly less severe and begin within the  first year of life. Features of the infantile form include hepatosplenomegaly,  dysostosis multiplex,"coarse"facial features, , and  disability. As children with infantile sialidosis type II get older, they may  develop myoclonus and cherry-red spots. Other signs and symptoms include hearing  loss, overgrowth of the gums (gingival hyperplasia), and widely spaced teeth.  Affected individuals may survive into childhood or adolescence. html:p The juvenile form has the least severe signs and symptoms of the different forms  of sialidosis type II. Features of this condition usually appear in late  childhood and may include mildly"coarse"facial features, mild bone  abnormalities, cherry-red spots, myoclonus,  disability, and dark  red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas).

Description1: html:p Sialuria is a rare disorder that has variable effects on development. Affected  infants are often born with a yellow tint to the skin and the whites of the eyes  (neonatal jaundice), an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and  unusually small red blood cells (microcytic anemia). They may develop a  somewhat flat face and distinctive-looking facial features that are described as  "coarse."Temporarily  and  () have  also been reported. html:p Young children with sialuria tend to have frequent upper respiratory infections  and episodes of dehydration and stomach upset (gastroenteritis). Older children  may have  and  difficulties. In some affected children,  development is nearly normal. html:p The features of sialuria vary widely among affected people. Many of the  problems associated with this disorder appear to improve with age, although  little is known about the long-term effects of the disease. It is likely that  some adults with sialuria never come to medical attention because they have very  mild signs and symptoms or no health problems related to the condition.

Description1: html:p Sick sinus syndrome (also known as sinus node dysfunction) is a group of related  heart conditions that can affect how the heart beats."Sick sinus"refers to  the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart  that functions as a natural pacemaker. The SA node generates electrical impulses  that start each heartbeat. These signals travel from the SA node to the rest of  the heart, signaling the heart (cardiac) muscle to contract and pump blood. In  people with sick sinus syndrome, the SA node does not function normally. In some  cases, it does not produce the right signals to trigger a regular heartbeat. In  others, abnormalities disrupt the electrical impulses and prevent them from  reaching the rest of the heart. html:p Sick sinus syndrome tends to cause the heartbeat to be too slow (bradycardia),  although occasionally the heartbeat is too fast (tachycardia). In some cases,  the heartbeat rapidly switches from being too fast to being too slow, a  condition known as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Symptoms related to  abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope),  a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), and  confusion or memory problems. During exercise, many affected individuals  experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive tiredness (fatigue).  Once symptoms of sick sinus syndrome appear, they usually worsen with time.  However, some people with the condition never experience any related health  problems. html:p Sick sinus syndrome occurs most commonly in older adults, although it can be  diagnosed in people of any age. The condition increases the risk of several  life-threatening problems involving the heart and blood vessels. These include a  heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac  arrest, and stroke.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Sickle cell disease is a group of disorders that affects hemoglobin, the</span>  molecule in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body.  People with this disorder have atypical hemoglobin molecules called hemoglobin  S, which can distort red blood cells into a sickle, or crescent, shape. html:p Signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease usually begin in early childhood.  Characteristic features of this disorder include a low number of red blood cells  (anemia), repeated infections, and periodic episodes of pain. The severity of  symptoms varies from person to person. Some people have mild symptoms, while  others are frequently hospitalized for more serious complications. html:p The signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease are caused by the sickling of red  blood cells. When red blood cells sickle, they break down prematurely, which  can lead to anemia. Anemia can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and  and  in children. The rapid breakdown of red blood cells may  also cause yellowing of the eyes and skin, which are signs of jaundice. Painful  episodes can occur when sickled red blood cells, which are stiff and  inflexible, get stuck in small blood vessels. These episodes deprive tissues  and organs of oxygen-rich blood and can lead to organ damage, especially in the  lungs, kidneys, spleen, and brain. A particularly serious complication of  sickle cell disease is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the  lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Pulmonary hypertension occurs in about  one-third of adults with sickle cell disease and can lead to heart failure.

Description1: html:p Silver syndrome belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as hereditary  spastic paraplegias. These disorders are characterized by progressive  and, frequently,  . Hereditary spastic paraplegias are divided into two types:  pure and complex. Both types involve the lower limbs; the complex types may also  involve the upper limbs, although to a lesser degree. In addition, the complex  types may affect the brain and parts of the nervous system involved in muscle  movement and sensations. Silver syndrome is a complex hereditary spastic  paraplegia. html:p The first sign of Silver syndrome is usually weakness in the muscles of the  hands. These muscles waste away (amyotrophy), resulting in abnormal positioning  of the thumbs and difficulty using the fingers and hands for tasks such as  handwriting. People with Silver syndrome often have high-arched feet (pes cavus)  And . The signs and symptoms of Silver syndrome typically  begin in late childhood but can start anytime from early childhood to late  adulthood. The muscle problems associated with Silver syndrome slowly worsen  with age, but affected individuals can remain active throughout life.

Description1: html:p Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the  body and occurs primarily in males. This condition is classified as an  syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger  than normal at birth and continue to grow and gain weight at an  unusual rate. The other signs and symptoms of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome  vary widely. People with mild cases often live into adulthood. html:p People with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome have distinctive facial features  including widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), an unusually large mouth  (macrostomia), a large tongue (macroglossia) that may have a deep groove or  furrow down the middle, a broad nose with an upturned tip, and abnormalities  affecting the roof of the mouth (the palate). The facial features are often  described as"coarse"in older children and adults with this condition. html:p Other features of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome involve the chest and abdomen.  Affected infants may be born with one or more extra nipples, an abnormal opening  in the muscle covering the abdomen (diastasis recti), a soft out-pouching  around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), or a hole in the diaphragm (a  diaphragmatic hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the  chest and crowd the developing heart and lungs. html:p Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome can also cause s, malformed or  abnormally large kidneys, an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and  skeletal abnormalities. Additionally, the syndrome can affect the development  of the gastrointestinal system, urinary system, and genitalia. Some people with  this condition have mild to severe  disability, while others have  normal intelligence. html:p About 10 percent of people with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome develop cancerous  or noncancerous tumors in early childhood. The most common tumors are a rare  form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor and a cancerous tumor called a  neuroblastoma that arises from developing nerve cells.

frequency1: Only 80 to 100 individuals with sitosterolemia have been described in the medical literature. However, researchers believe that this condition is likely underdiagnosed because mild cases often do not come to medical attention. Studies suggest that the prevalence may be at least 1 in 50,000 people.
Description1: html:p Sitosterolemia is a condition in which fatty substances (lipids) from vegetable  oils, nuts, and other plant-based foods accumulate in the blood and tissues.  These lipids are called plant sterols (or phytosterols). Sitosterol is one of  several plant sterols that accumulate in this disorder, with a blood level 30 to  100 times greater than normal. Cholesterol, a similar fatty substance found in  animal products, is mildly to moderately elevated in many people with  sitosterolemia. Cholesterol levels are particularly high in some affected  children. However, some people with sitosterolemia have normal cholesterol  levels. html:p Plant sterols are not produced by the body; they are taken in as components of  foods. Signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia may begin to appear early in life  after foods containing plant sterols are introduced into the diet, although some  affected individuals have no obvious symptoms. html:p In people with sitosterolemia, accumulation of fatty deposits in arteries  (atherosclerosis) can occur as early as childhood. These deposits narrow the  arteries and can eventually block blood flow, increasing the chance of a heart  attack, stroke, or sudden death. html:p Some people with sitosterolemia develop small yellowish growths called xanthomas  beginning in childhood. Xanthomas consist of accumulated lipids and may be  located anywhere on or just under the skin, typically on the heels, knees,  elbows, and buttocks. They may also occur in the bands that connect muscles to  bones (tendons), including tendons of the hand and the tendon that connects the  heel of the foot to the calf muscles (the Achilles tendon). Large xanthomas can  cause pain, difficulty with movement, and cosmetic problems. html:p Joint stiffness and pain resulting from plant sterol deposits may also occur in  individuals with sitosterolemia. Less often, affected individuals have blood  abnormalities. Occasionally the blood abnormalities are the only signs of the  disorder. The red blood cells may be broken down (undergo hemolysis)  prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). This type of  anemia is called hemolytic anemia. Affected individuals sometimes have  abnormally shaped red blood cells called stomatocytes. In addition, the blood  cell fragments involved in clotting, called platelets or thrombocytes, may be  abnormally large (macrothrombocytopenia).

Description1: html:p Sjögren-Larsson syndrome is a condition characterized by dry, scaly skin  (ichthyosis); neurological problems; and eye problems. These symptoms are  apparent by early childhood and usually do not worsen with age. html:p Affected infants tend to be born prematurely. At birth the skin is red  (erythema), but later in infancy the skin becomes dry, rough, and scaly with a  brownish or yellowish tone. Mild to severe itchiness (pruritus) is also common.  These skin abnormalities are generally dispersed over the whole body, most  severely affecting the nape of the neck, the torso, and the extremities. The  skin of the face is usually not affected. html:p People with this condition may also have neurological signs and symptoms. Most  affected individuals have leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of  brain tissue called white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers covered  by a substance (myelin) that insulates and protects the nerves. The  leukoencephalopathy is thought to contribute to many of the neurological signs  and symptoms in people with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. Most affected individuals  have  disability that varies from mild to profound and is usually  apparent by early childhood. People with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome have  difficulties () and delayed .

Based on their  appearance, these retinal crystals are often called glistening white dots. These  white dots are usually apparent by early childhood, and it is unclear if they  affect normal vision. People with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome may also have  nearsightedness (myopia) or an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Sjögren syndrome is a disorder whose main features are dry eyes and a dry mouth.</span>  The condition typically develops gradually beginning in middle adulthood, but  it can occur at any age. html:p Sjögren syndrome is classified as an autoimmune disorder, one of a large group  of conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues  and organs. In Sjögren syndrome, the immune system primarily attacks the glands  that produce tears (the lacrimal glands) and saliva (the salivary glands),  impairing the glands' ability to secrete these fluids. html:p Dry eyes may lead to itching, burning, a feeling of sand in the eyes, blurry  vision, or intolerance of bright or fluorescent lighting. A dry mouth can feel  chalky or full of cotton, and affected individuals may have difficulty speaking,  tasting food, or swallowing. Because saliva helps protect the teeth and the  tissues of the oral cavity, people with Sjögren syndrome are at increased risk  of tooth decay and infections in the mouth. html:p In most people with Sjögren syndrome, dry eyes and dry mouth are the primary  features of the disorder, and general health and life expectancy are largely  unaffected. However, in some cases the immune system also attacks and damages  other organs and tissues. This complication is known as extraglandular  involvement. Affected individuals may develop inflammation in connective  tissues, which provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the  body. Disorders involving connective tissue inflammation are sometimes called  rheumatic conditions. In Sjögren syndrome, extraglandular involvement may result  in painful inflammation of the joints and muscles; dry, itchy skin and skin  rashes; chronic cough; a hoarse voice; kidney and liver problems; numbness or  tingling in the hands and feet; and, in women, vaginal dryness. Prolonged and  extreme tiredness (fatigue) severe enough to affect activities of daily living  may also occur in this disorder. A small number of people with Sjögren syndrome  develop lymphoma, a blood-related cancer that causes tumor formation in the  lymph nodes. html:p Some individuals who are first diagnosed with another rheumatic disorder, such  as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, later develop the dry  eyes and dry mouth characteristic of Sjögren syndrome. Other autoimmune  disorders can also develop after the onset of Sjögren syndrome. In all, about  half of all individuals with Sjögren syndrome also have another autoimmune  disorder.

frequency1: The prevalence of small fiber neuropathy is unknown.
Description1: html:p Small fiber neuropathy is a condition characterized by severe pain attacks that  typically begin in the feet or hands. As a person ages, the pain attacks can  affect other regions. Some people initially experience a more generalized,  whole-body pain. The attacks usually consist of pain described as stabbing or  burning, or abnormal skin sensations such as tingling or itchiness. In some  individuals, the pain is more severe during times of rest or at night. The signs  and symptoms of small fiber neuropathy usually begin in adolescence to  mid-adulthood. html:p Individuals with small fiber neuropathy cannot feel pain that is concentrated in  a very small area, such as the prick of a pin. However, they have an increased  sensitivity to pain in general (hyperalgesia) and experience pain from  stimulation that typically does not cause pain (hypoesthesia). People affected  with this condition may also have a reduced ability to differentiate between hot  and cold. However, in some individuals, the pain attacks are provoked by cold  or warm triggers. html:p Some affected individuals have urinary or bowel problems, episodes of rapid  heartbeat (palpitations), dry eyes or mouth, or abnormal sweating. They can also  experience a sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic  hypotension), which can cause dizziness, blurred vision, or fainting. html:p Small fiber neuropathy is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it  affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord  to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain.

Weakness or"floppiness"() typically becomes  apparent in infancy, and the loss of muscle tissue continues with age. People  with this condition often have difficulty walking; most have an unsteady gait. html:p Snyder-Robinson syndrome causes skeletal problems, particularly thinning of the  bones (osteoporosis) that starts in early childhood. Osteoporosis causes the  bones to be brittle and to break easily, often during normal activities. In  people with Snyder-Robinson syndrome, broken bones occur most often in the arms  and legs. Most affected individuals also develop an abnormal side-to-side and  back-to-front curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis, often called  kyphoscoliosis when they occur together). Affected individuals tend to be  shorter than their peers and others in their family. html:p Snyder-Robinson syndrome is associated with distinctive facial features,  including a prominent lower lip; a high, narrow roof of the mouth or an opening  in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate); and differences in the size and shape  of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Other signs and  symptoms that have been reported include  that begin in childhood and  abnormalities of the kidneys.

These disorders are characterized by progressive    caused by degeneration of nerve cells (neurons) that trigger  muscle movement. Hereditary spastic paraplegias are divided into two types: pure  and complicated. The pure types involve only the lower limbs, while the  complicated types also involve the upper limbs and other areas of the body,  including the brain. Spastic paraplegia type 31 is usually a pure hereditary  spastic paraplegia, although a few complicated cases have been reported. html:p The first signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 31 usually appear before  age 20 or after age 30. An early feature is difficulty walking due to  , which typically affect both legs equally. People with  spastic paraplegia type 31 can also experience progressive muscle wasting  (amyotrophy) in the lower limbs, exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), a  decreased ability to feel vibrations, reduced bladder control, and high-arched  feet (pes cavus). As the condition progresses, some individuals require walking  support.

In the United States, this condition occurs more frequently in Hispanics</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">and non-Hispanic whites than in African Americans.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Spina bifida is a condition in which the neural tube, a layer of cells that</span>  ultimately develops into the brain and spinal cord, fails to close completely  during the first few weeks of embryonic development. As a result, when the spine  forms, the bones of the spinal column do not close completely around the  developing nerves of the spinal cord. Part of the spinal cord may stick out  through an opening in the spine, leading to permanent nerve damage. Because  spina bifida is caused by abnormalities of the neural tube, it is classified as  a neural tube defect. html:p Children born with spina bifida often have a fluid-filled sac on their back that  is covered by skin, called a meningocele. If the sac contains part of the  spinal cord and its protective covering, it is known as a myelomeningocele. The  signs and symptoms of these abnormalities range from mild to severe, depending  on where the opening in the spinal column is located and how much of the spinal  cord is affected. Related problems can include a loss of feeling below the level  of the opening, weakness or paralysis of the feet or legs, and problems with  bladder and bowel control. Some affected individuals have additional  complications, including a buildup of excess fluid around the brain  (hydrocephalus) and  problems. With surgery and other forms of  treatment, many people with spina bifida live into adulthood. html:p In a milder form of the condition, called spina bifida occulta, the bones of the  spinal column are abnormally formed, but the nerves of the spinal cord usually  develop normally. Unlike in the more severe form of spina bifida, the nerves do  not stick out through an opening in the spine. Spina bifida occulta most often  causes no health problems, although rarely it can cause back pain or changes in  bladder function.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the control of muscle</span>  movement. It is caused by a loss of specialized nerve cells, called motor  neurons, in the spinal cord and the part of the brain that is connected to the  spinal cord (the brainstem). The loss of motor neurons leads to weakness and  wasting (atrophy) of muscles used for activities such as crawling, walking,  sitting up, and controlling head movement. In severe cases of spinal muscular  atrophy, the muscles used for breathing and swallowing are affected. There are  many types of spinal muscular atrophy distinguished by the pattern of features,  severity of muscle weakness, and age when the muscle problems begin. html:p Type I spinal muscular atrophy (also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease) is a severe  form of the disorder that is evident at birth or within the first few months of  life. Affected infants are ;  . Children with this type have breathing and  swallowing problems that may lead to choking or gagging. html:p Type II spinal muscular atrophy is characterized by muscle weakness that  develops in children between ages 6 and 12 months. Children with type II can sit  without support, although they may need help getting to a seated position.  Individuals with this type of spinal muscular atrophy cannot stand or walk  unaided. html:p Type III spinal muscular atrophy (also called Kugelberg-Welander disease or  juvenile type) has milder features that typically develop between early  childhood and adolescence. Individuals with type III spinal muscular atrophy can  stand and walk unaided, but walking and climbing stairs may become increasingly  difficult. Many affected individuals will require wheelchair assistance later  in life. html:p The signs and symptoms of type IV spinal muscular atrophy often occur after age  30. Affected individuals usually experience mild to moderate,  , twitching, or mild breathing problems. Typically, only muscles close to  the center of the body (proximal muscles), such as the upper arms and legs, are  affected in type IV spinal muscular atrophy. html:p The features of X-linked spinal muscular atrophy appear in infancy and include  severe muscle weakness and difficulty breathing. Children with this type often  have  that impair movement. In severe cases,  affected infants are born with broken bones. Poor muscle tone before birth may  contribute to the  and broken bones seen in these children. html:p Spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity, dominant (SMA-LED) is characterized by  leg muscle weakness that is most severe in the thigh muscles (quadriceps). This  weakness begins in infancy or early childhood and progresses slowly. Affected  individuals often have a waddling or unsteady walk and have difficulty rising  from a seated position and climbing stairs. html:p An adult-onset form of spinal muscular atrophy that begins in early to  mid-adulthood affects the proximal muscles and is characterized by muscle  cramping of the limbs and abdomen, weakness in the leg muscles, involuntary  muscle contractions, s, and a protrusion of the abdomen thought to be  related to muscle weakness. Some affected individuals experience difficulty  swallowing and problems with bladder and bowel function.

After a few  years of normal development, affected children begin experiencing muscle  weakness and atrophy in the lower limbs, causing difficulty walking and frequent  falls. The muscles in the upper limbs are later affected, and soon the muscle  weakness and atrophy spreads throughout the body. Once weakness reaches the  muscles used for breathing and swallowing, it leads to life-threatening  breathing problems and increased susceptibility to pneumonia. html:p A few years after the muscle weakness begins, affected individuals start to  experience recurrent  ().

Early features of this condition are difficult  and noisy breathing, especially when inhaling; a weak cry; problems feeding; and  recurrent episodes of pneumonia. Typically between the ages of 6 weeks and 6  months, infants with this condition will experience a sudden inability to  breathe due to paralysis of the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest  cavity (the diaphragm). Normally, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward  during inhalation to allow the lungs to expand. With diaphragm paralysis,  affected individuals require life-long support with a machine to help them  breathe (mechanical ventilation). Rarely, children with SMARD1 develop signs or  symptoms of the disorder later in childhood. html:p Soon after respiratory failure occurs, individuals with SMARD1 develop muscle  weakness in their distal muscles. These are the muscles farther from the center  of the body, such as muscles in the hands and feet. The weakness soon spreads to  all muscles; however, within 2 years, the muscle weakness typically stops  getting worse. Some individuals may retain a low level of muscle function, while  others lose all ability to move their muscles. Muscle weakness severely  Impairs . Some affected  children develop an abnormal side-to-side and back-to-front curvature of the  spine (scoliosis and kyphosis, often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur  together). After approximately the first year of life, individuals with SMARD1  may lose their deep tendon reflexes, such as the reflex being tested when a  doctor taps the knee with a hammer. html:p Other features of SMARD1 can include reduced pain sensitivity, excessive  sweating (hyperhidrosis), loss of bladder and bowel control, and an irregular  heartbeat (arrhythmia).

These tongue problems can cause difficulties swallowing liquids.  As the condition progresses, individuals with SCA36 develop muscle atrophy in  the legs, forearms, and hands. Another common feature of SCA36 is the atrophy of  specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons), which can  contribute to the tongue and limb muscle atrophy in affected individuals. html:p Some people with SCA36 have abnormalities of the eye muscles, which can lead to  involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), rapid eye movements (saccades), trouble  moving the eyes side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia), and droopy eyelids (ptosis).

Over time, the loss of cells in the  cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA36. In older  affected individuals, the frontal lobes of the brain may show atrophy resulting  in loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement  actions and develop problem-solving strategies. html:p Signs and symptoms of SCA36 typically begin in a person's forties or fifties but  can appear anytime during adulthood.

Description1: html:p Spondylocostal dysostosis is a group of conditions characterized by abnormal  . The  bones of the spine (vertebrae). Many people with this  condition have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) due to  malformation of the vertebrae. In addition to spinal abnormalities, some of the  rib bones may be fused together or missing. Affected individuals have short,  rigid necks and short torsos because of the bone malformations. As a result,  people with spondylocostal dysostosis have short bodies but normal-length arms  and legs, called short-trunk dwarfism. html:p The spine and rib abnormalities, which are present from birth, cause other signs  and symptoms of spondylocostal dysostosis. Infants with this condition have  small chests that cannot expand adequately, often leading to life-threatening  breathing problems. As the lungs expand in the narrow chest, the muscle that  separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) is forced down and  the abdomen is pushed out. The increased pressure in the abdomen can cause a  soft out-pouching around the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia), particularly in  males with spondylocostal dysostosis. html:p Some people with spondylocostal dysostosis also have a type of birth defect  known as a neural tube defect. Neural tube defects occur when a structure called  the neural tube, a layer of cells that ultimately develops into the brain and  spinal cord, fails to close completely during the first few weeks of embryonic  development. Examples of neural tube defects that occur in people with  spondylocostal dysostosis include a spinal cord abnormality known as spina  bifida and a brain abnormality called a Chiari malformation. html:p Although breathing problems can be fatal early in life, many affected  individuals live into adulthood. html:p Spondylocostal dysostosis has often been grouped with a similar condition called  spondylothoracic dysostosis, and both are sometimes called Jarcho-Levin  syndrome; however, they are now considered distinct conditions.

Description1: html:p Spondylothoracic dysostosis is a condition characterized by malformation of the  bones of the spine and ribs. The bones of the spine (vertebrae) do not develop  properly, which causes them to be misshapen and abnormally joined together  (fused). The ribs are also fused at the part nearest the spine (posteriorly),  which gives the rib cage its characteristic fan-like or"crab"appearance in  x-rays. Affected individuals have short, rigid necks and short torsos because  of the bone malformations. As a result, people with spondylothoracic dysostosis  have short bodies but normal-length arms and legs, called short-trunk dwarfism. html:p The spine and rib abnormalities, which are present from birth, cause other signs  and symptoms of spondylothoracic dysostosis. Infants with this condition have  small chests that cannot expand adequately, often leading to life-threatening  breathing problems. As the lungs expand in the narrow chest, the muscle that  separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) is forced down and  the abdomen is pushed out. The increased pressure in the abdomen can cause a  soft out-pouching around the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia) or belly-button  (umbilical hernia). html:p Breathing problems can be fatal early in life; however, some affected  individuals live into adulthood. html:p Spondylothoracic dysostosis is sometimes called spondylocostal dysostosis, a  similar condition with abnormalities of the spine and ribs. The two conditions  have been grouped in the past, and both are sometimes referred to as  Jarcho-Levin syndrome; however, they are now considered distinct conditions.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sporadic-hemiplegic-migraine
frequency1: The worldwide prevalence of sporadic hemiplegic migraine is unknown. Studies suggest that in Denmark about 1 in 10,000 people have hemiplegic migraine and that the condition occurs equally in families with multiple affected individuals (familial hemiplegic migraine) and in individuals with no family history of the condition (sporadic hemiplegic migraine).
Description1: html:p Sporadic hemiplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine headache. Migraines  typically cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head. Some people  with migraines also experience nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and  sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and  can be triggered by certain foods, emotional stress, and minor head trauma.  Each headache may last from a few hours to a few days. html:p In sporadic hemiplegic migraine and some other types of migraine, a pattern of  neurological symptoms called an aura occurs before onset of the headache. An  aura commonly includes temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas),  flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with sporadic  hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or  weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). Additional  features of an aura can include difficulty with , confusion, and  drowsiness. An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts  about an hour. html:p Some people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine experience unusually severe  migraine episodes. These episodes can include fever, prolonged weakness,  , and coma. Although most people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine  recover completely between episodes, neurological symptoms such as memory loss  and problems with attention can last for weeks or months. Some affected  individuals develop mild but permanent difficulty s  , which may worsen with time, and rapid, involuntary eye movements  called nystagmus. Mild to severe  disability has been reported in  some people with sporadic hemiplegic migraine.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Stargardt macular degeneration is a genetic eye disorder that causes progressive</span>  vision loss. This disorder affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive  tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, Stargardt macular  degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina called the  macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for  detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. In most people  with Stargardt macular degeneration, a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) builds  up in cells underlying the macula. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this  substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. In  addition to central vision loss, people with Stargardt macular degeneration have  problems with night vision that can make it difficult to navigate in low light.  Some affected individuals also have impaired color vision. The signs and  symptoms of Stargardt macular degeneration typically appear in late childhood to  early adulthood and worsen over time.

frequency1: SJS/TEN is a rare disease, affecting 1 to 2 per million people each year. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (the less severe form of the condition) is more common than toxic epidermal necrolysis.People who are HIV-positive and those with a chronic inflammatory disease called systemic lupus erythematosus are more likely to develop SJS/TEN than the general population. The reason for the increased risk is unclear, but immune system factors and exposure to multiple medications may play a role.
Description1: html:p Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a severe skin  reaction most often triggered by particular medications. Although  Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were once thought to be  separate conditions, they are now considered part of a continuum.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome represents the less severe end of the disease spectrum,  and toxic epidermal necrolysis represents the more severe end. html:p SJS/TEN often begins with a fever and flu-like symptoms. Within a few days, the  skin begins to blister and peel, forming very painful raw areas called erosions  that resemble a severe hot-water burn. The skin erosions usually start on the  face and chest before spreading to other parts of the body. In most affected  individuals, the condition also damages the mucous membranes, including the  lining of the mouth and the airways, which can cause trouble with swallowing and  breathing. The painful blistering can also affect the urinary tract and  genitals. SJS/TEN often affects the eyes as well, causing irritation and redness  of the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part  of the eye and line the eyelids, and damage to the clear front covering of the  eye (the cornea). html:p Severe damage to the skin and mucous membranes makes SJS/TEN a life-threatening  disease. Because the skin normally acts as a protective barrier, extensive skin  damage can lead to a dangerous loss of fluids and allow infections to develop.  Serious complications can include pneumonia, overwhelming bacterial infections  (sepsis), shock, multiple organ failure, and death. About 10 percent of people  with Stevens-Johnson syndrome die from the disease, while the condition is fatal  in up to 50 percent of those with toxic epidermal necrolysis. html:p Among people who survive, long-term effects of SJS/TEN can include changes in  skin coloring (pigmentation), dryness of the skin and mucous membranes  (xerosis), excess sweating (hyperhidrosis), hair loss (alopecia), and abnormal  growth or loss of the fingernails and toenails. Other long-term problems can  include impaired taste, difficulty urinating, and . A small  percentage of affected individuals develop chronic dryness or inflammation of  the eyes, which can lead to increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) and  vision impairment.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Stickler syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 7,500 to 9,000 newborns. Type I</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">is the most common form of the condition.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Stickler syndrome is a group of hereditary conditions characterized by a</span>  distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint  problems. These signs and symptoms vary widely among affected individuals. html:p A characteristic feature of Stickler syndrome is a somewhat flattened facial  appearance. This appearance results from underdeveloped bones in the middle of  the face, including the cheekbones and the bridge of the nose. A particular  group of physical features called Pierre Robin sequence is also common in people  with Stickler syndrome. Pierre Robin sequence includes an opening in the roof  of the mouth (a cleft palate), a tongue that is placed further back than normal  (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). This combination of  features can lead to feeding problems and difficulty breathing. html:p Many people with Stickler syndrome have severe nearsightedness (high myopia). In  some cases, the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous) has an abnormal  appearance, which is noticeable during an eye examination. Other eye problems  are also common, including increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma),  clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), and tearing of the lining of the  eye (retinal detachment). These eye abnormalities cause impaired vision or  blindness in some cases. html:p In people with Stickler syndrome, hearing loss varies in degree and may become  more severe over time. The hearing loss may be sensorineural, meaning that it  results from changes in the inner ear, or conductive, meaning that it is caused  by abnormalities of the middle ear. html:p Most people with Stickler syndrome have skeletal abnormalities that affect the  joints. The joints of affected children and young adults may be loose and very  flexible (hypermobile), though joints become less flexible with age. Arthritis  often appears early in life and may cause joint pain or stiffness. Problems with  the bones of the spine (vertebrae) can also occur, including abnormal curvature  of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis) and flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly).  These spinal abnormalities may cause back pain. html:p Researchers have described several types of Stickler syndrome, which are  distinguished by their genetic causes and their patterns of signs and symptoms.  In particular, the eye abnormalities and severity of hearing loss differ among  the types. Type I has the highest risk of retinal detachment. Type II also  includes eye abnormalities, but type III does not (and is often called  non-ocular Stickler syndrome). Types II and III are more likely than type I to  have significant hearing loss. Types IV, V, and VI are very rare and have each  been diagnosed in only a few individuals. html:p A condition similar to Stickler syndrome, called Marshall syndrome, is  characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing  loss, and early-onset arthritis. Marshall syndrome can also include  . Some researchers have classified Marshall syndrome as a variant of  Stickler syndrome, while others consider it to be a separate disorder.

frequency1: The prevalence of this condition is unknown. Only a few affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a disorder  involving abnormal inflammation throughout the body, especially in the skin,  blood vessels, and lungs. Inflammation normally occurs when the immune system  sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease  to fight microbial invaders and help with tissue repair. Excessive inflammation  damages the body's own cells and tissues. Disorders such as SAVI that result  from abnormally increased inflammation are known as autoinflammatory diseases. html:p The signs and symptoms of SAVI begin in the first few months of life, and most  are related to problems with blood vessels (vasculopathy) and damage to the  tissues that rely on these vessels for their blood supply. Affected infants  develop areas of severely damaged skin (lesions), particularly on the face,  ears, nose, fingers, and toes. These lesions begin as rashes and can progress to  become wounds (ulcers) and dead tissue (necrosis). The skin problems, which  worsen in cold weather, can lead to complications such as scarred ears, a hole  in the tissue that separates the two nostrils (nasal septum perforation), or  fingers or toes that require amputation. Individuals with SAVI also have a  purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the  tiny blood vessels of the skin. Affected individuals may also experience  episodes of Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers and toes turn white or blue  in response to cold temperature or other stresses. This effect occurs because  of problems with the small vessels that carry blood to the extremities. html:p In addition to problems affecting the skin, people with SAVI have recurrent  low-grade fevers and swollen lymph nodes. They may also develop widespread lung  damage (interstitial lung disease) that can lead to the formation of scar tissue  in the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis) and difficulty breathing; these respiratory  complications can become life-threatening. Rarely, muscle inflammation  (myositis) and joint stiffness also occur.

frequency1: Sturge-Weber syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 20,000 to 50,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Sturge-Weber syndrome is a condition that affects the development of certain  blood vessels, causing abnormalities in the brain, skin, and eyes. Sturge-Weber  syndrome has three major features: a red or pink birthmark called a port-wine  birthmark, a brain abnormality called a leptomeningeal angioma, and increased  pressure in the eye (glaucoma). Not all individuals with Sturge-Weber syndrome  have all three features. html:p Most people with Sturge-Weber syndrome are born with a port-wine birthmark. This  type of birthmark is caused by enlargement (dilatation) of small blood vessels  (capillaries) near the surface of the skin. Port-wine birthmarks are typically  initially flat and can vary in color from pale pink to deep purple. In people  with Sturge-Weber syndrome, the port-wine birthmark is on the face, typically on  the forehead, temple, or eyelid. The port-wine birthmark is usually only on one  side of the face but can be on both sides. html:p In Sturge-Weber syndrome, there is usually abnormal formation and growth of  blood vessels within the two thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and  spinal cord. This abnormality, which is called leptomeningeal angioma, can  impair blood flow in the brain and lead to loss of brain tissue (atrophy) and  deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain below the angioma. The decrease  in blood flow caused by leptomeningeal angiomas can cause stroke-like episodes  in people with Sturge-Weber syndrome. These episodes often involve temporary  muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), vision abnormalities,  , and migraine headaches. In affected individuals, these episodes  usually begin by age 2. The  usually involve only one side of the brain  (focal ), during which the port-wine birthmark may darken and  individuals may lose consciousness. People with Sturge-Weber syndrome have  varying levels of cognitive function, from normal intelligence to  disability. html:p In individuals with Sturge-Weber syndrome, glaucoma typically develops either in  infancy or early adulthood and can cause vision impairment. In some affected  infants, the pressure can become so great that the eyeballs appear enlarged and  bulging (buphthalmos). Individuals with Sturge-Weber syndrome can have tangles  of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas) in various parts of the eye. When these  abnormal blood vessels develop in the network of blood vessels at the back of  the eye (choroid), it is called a diffuse choroidal hemangioma and occurs in  about one-third of individuals with Sturge-Weber syndrome. A diffuse choroidal  hemangioma can cause vision loss. When present, the eye abnormalities typically  occur on the same side of the head as the port-wine birthmark.

Many babies with this condition do not survive past infancy because of the  problems regulating breathing and body temperature; however, some people with  Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome live into adolescence or later. html:p Problems with breathing and swallowing usually improve in affected children who  survive infancy; however, they still have difficulty regulating body  temperature. In addition, the leg bowing worsens, and children with  Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome may develop prominent joints, an abnormal curvature of  the spine (scoliosis), and spontaneous bone fractures. Some affected individuals  have a smooth tongue that lacks the bumps that house taste buds (fungiform  papillae). Affected children may also lose certain reflexes, particularly the  reflex to blink when something touches the eye (corneal reflex) and the  knee-jerk reflex (patellar reflex). html:p Another condition once known as Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 is now  considered to be part of Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome. Researchers have recommended  that the designation Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 no longer be used.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/succinate-coa-ligase-deficiency
frequency1: Although the exact prevalence of succinate-CoA ligase deficiency is unknown, it appears to be very rare. This condition occurs more frequently among people from the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean.
Description1: html:p Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects the early  development of the brain and other body systems. One of the earliest signs of  the disorder is very  (severe ), which appears in the  first few months of life. Severe  skills such as holding up the head and rolling over. Many affected children also  have muscle weakness and reduced muscle mass, which prevents them from standing  and walking independently. html:p Additional features of succinate-CoA ligase deficiency can include progressive  abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis),  , severe hearing loss, and  beginning in childhood. In most  affected children, a substance called methylmalonic acid builds up abnormally in  the body and is excreted in urine (methylmalonic aciduria). Most children with  succinate-CoA ligase deficiency also experience a failure to thrive, which  means that they gain weight and grow more slowly than expected. html:p Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency causes breathing difficulties that often lead to  recurrent infections of the respiratory tract. These infections can be  life-threatening, and most people with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency live only  into childhood or adolescence. html:p A few individuals with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency have had an even more  severe form of the disorder known as fatal infantile lactic acidosis. Affected  infants develop a toxic buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis) in  the first day of life, which leads to muscle weakness and breathing  difficulties. Children with fatal infantile lactic acidosis usually live only a  few days after birth.

Description1: html:p Sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT) is a rare  condition that is fatal in the first year of life; its major features include  abnormalities of the reproductive system in males, feeding difficulties, and  breathing problems. html:p Infants with SIDDT who are genetically male, with one X chromosome and one Y  chromosome in each cell, have underdeveloped or abnormal testes. They may also    . In affected infants who are genetically  female, with two X chromosomes in each cell, development of the internal and  external reproductive organs is normal. html:p SIDDT is associated with abnormal development of the brain, particularly the  brainstem, which is the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord.  The brainstem regulates many basic body functions, including heart rate,  breathing, eating, and sleeping. It also relays information about movement and  the senses between the brain and the rest of the body. Many features of SIDDT  appear to be related to brainstem malfunction, including a slow or uneven heart  rate, abnormal breathing patterns, difficulty controlling body temperature,  unusual tongue and eye movements, abnormal reflexes, , and feeding  difficulties. Affected infants also have an unusual cry that has been described  as similar to the bleating of a goat, which is probably a result of abnormal  nerve connections between the brain and the voicebox (larynx). html:p The brainstem abnormalities lead to death in the first year of life, when  affected infants suddenly stop breathing or their heart stops beating  (cardiorespiratory arrest).

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/surfactant-dysfunction
frequency1: One type of surfactant dysfunction, SP-B deficiency, is estimated to occur in 1 in 1 million newborns worldwide. The prevalence of surfactant dysfunction due to other causes is unknown.
Description1: html:p Surfactant dysfunction is a lung disorder that causes breathing problems. This  condition results from abnormalities in the composition or function of  surfactant, a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that  lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the  tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together  (because of a force called surface tension) after exhalation, causing the  alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath  becomes very difficult, and the delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired. html:p The signs and symptoms of surfactant dysfunction can vary in severity. The most  severe form of this condition causes respiratory distress syndrome in newborns.  Affected babies have extreme difficulty breathing and are unable to get enough  oxygen. The lack of oxygen can damage the baby's brain and other organs. This  syndrome leads to respiratory failure, and most babies with this form of the  condition do not survive more than a few months. html:p Less severe forms of surfactant dysfunction cause gradual onset of breathing  problems in children or adults. Signs and symptoms of these milder forms are  abnormally rapid breathing (tachypnea); low concentrations of oxygen in the  blood (hypoxemia); and an inability to grow or gain weight at the expected rate  (failure to thrive). html:p There are several types of surfactant dysfunction, which are identified by the  genetic cause of the condition. One type, called SP-B deficiency, causes  respiratory distress syndrome in newborns. Other types, known as SP-C  dysfunction and ABCA3 deficiency, have signs and symptoms that range from mild  to severe.

Description1: html:p Swyer syndrome is a condition that affects . Sexual  development is usually determined by an individual's chromosomes; however, in  Swyer syndrome, sexual development does not match the affected individual's  chromosomal makeup. html:p People usually have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes,  known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether  a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Girls and women  typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX karyotype), while boys and men usually  have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY karyotype). In Swyer syndrome,  individuals with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell, the  pattern typically found in boys and men, have female reproductive structures. html:p People with Swyer syndrome have typical female external genitalia. The uterus  and fallopian tubes are normally-formed, but the gonads (ovaries or testes) are  not functional; affected individuals have undeveloped clumps of tissue called  streak gonads. Because of the, Swyer syndrome  is also called 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. The residual gonadal tissue  often becomes cancerous, so it is usually removed surgically early in life. html:p People with Swyer syndrome are typically raised as girls and have a female  gender identity. Because they do not have functional ovaries, affected  individuals usually begin hormone replacement therapy during adolescence to  induce menstruation and  such  as breast enlargement and uterine growth. Hormone replacement therapy also  helps reduce the risk of reduced bone density (osteopenia and osteoporosis).  Women with this disorder do not produce eggs (ova), but they may be able to  become pregnant with a donated egg or embryo. html:p Swyer syndrome usually affects only sexual development; such cases are called  isolated Swyer syndrome. However, depending on the genetic cause, Swyer syndrome  may also occur along with health conditions such as nerve problems (neuropathy)  or as part of a syndrome such as campomelic dysplasia, which causes severe  skeletal abnormalities.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">SLE has been estimated to affect between 322,000 and 1.5 million people in</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">the United States. The exact prevalence is difficult to determine because many</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">of the signs and symptoms of SLE resemble those of other disorders. Diagnosis</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">may be delayed for years, and the condition may never be diagnosed in some</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">affected individuals. Females develop SLE about nine times more often than</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">males. It is most common in younger women, peaking during the childbearing</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">years; however, 20 percent of SLE cases occur in people over age 50.For unknown</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">reasons, in industrialized Western countries SLE has become 10 times more common</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">over the past 50 years. The prevalence of SLE in Africa and Asia is believed to</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">be much lower than in Western nations; however, in industrialized Western</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">countries, people of African and Asian descent are two to four times more likely</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">to develop SLE than are people of European descent. Researchers suggest that</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">factors such as ethnic mixing, tobacco use in industrialized countries, and the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">different types of infections people acquire in different regions may contribute</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">to these differences. For example malaria, which occurs often in tropical</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">regions, is thought to be protective against SLE, while the Epstein-Barr virus,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">more common in the West, increases SLE risk.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation</span>  in connective tissues, such as cartilage and the lining of blood vessels, which  provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. The signs  and symptoms of SLE vary among affected individuals, and can involve many organs  and systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, central nervous  system, and blood-forming (hematopoietic) system. SLE is one of a large group of  conditions called autoimmune disorders that occur when the immune system  attacks the body's own tissues and organs. html:p SLE may first appear as extreme tiredness (fatigue), a vague feeling of  discomfort or illness (malaise), fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Most  affected individuals also have joint pain, typically affecting the same joints  on both sides of the body, and muscle pain and weakness. Skin problems are  common in SLE. A characteristic feature is a flat red rash across the cheeks and  bridge of the nose, called a"butterfly rash"because of its shape. The rash,  which generally does not hurt or itch, often appears or becomes more pronounced  when exposed to sunlight. Other skin problems that may occur in SLE include  calcium deposits under the skin (calcinosis), damaged blood vessels (vasculitis)  in the skin, and tiny red spots called petechiae. Petechiae are caused by a  shortage of cell fragments involved in clotting (platelets), which leads to  bleeding under the skin. Affected individuals may also have hair loss (alopecia)  and open sores (ulcerations) in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, nose,  or, less commonly, the genitals. html:p About a third of people with SLE develop kidney disease (nephritis). Heart  problems may also occur in SLE, including inflammation of the sac-like membrane  around the heart (pericarditis) and abnormalities of the heart valves, which  control blood flow in the heart. Heart disease caused by fatty buildup in the  blood vessels (atherosclerosis), which is very common in the general population,  is even more common in people with SLE. The inflammation characteristic of SLE  can also damage the nervous system, and may result in abnormal sensation and  weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy); ; stroke; and difficulty  processing, , and remembering information (cognitive impairment).  and  are also common in SLE. html:p People with SLE have episodes in which the condition gets worse (exacerbations)  and other times when it gets better (remissions). Overall, SLE gradually gets  worse over time, and damage to the major organs of the body can be  life-threatening.

GHR-webpage1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/systemic-scleroderma</span>
frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">The prevalence of systemic scleroderma is estimated to range from 50 to 300</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">cases per 1 million people. For reasons that are unknown, women are four times</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">more likely to develop the condition than men.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Systemic scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and</span>  internal organs. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions  and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. The word"scleroderma"means hard  skin in Greek, and the condition is characterized by the buildup of scar tissue  (fibrosis) in the skin and other organs. The condition is also called systemic  sclerosis because the fibrosis can affect organs other than the skin. Fibrosis  is due to the excess production of a tough protein called collagen, which  normally strengthens and supports connective tissues throughout the body. html:p The signs and symptoms of systemic scleroderma usually begin with episodes of  Raynaud phenomenon, which can occur weeks to years before fibrosis. In Raynaud  phenomenon, the fingers and toes of affected individuals turn white or blue in  response to cold temperature or other stresses. This effect occurs because of  problems with the small vessels that carry blood to the extremities. Another  early sign of systemic scleroderma is puffy or swollen hands before thickening  and hardening of the skin due to fibrosis. Skin thickening usually occurs first  in the fingers (called sclerodactyly) and may also involve the hands and face.  In addition, people with systemic scleroderma often have open sores (ulcers) on  their fingers, painful bumps under the skin (calcinosis), or small clusters of  enlarged blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectasia). html:p Fibrosis can also affect internal organs and can lead to impairment or failure  of the affected organs. The most commonly affected organs are the esophagus,  heart, lungs, and kidneys. Internal organ involvement may be signaled by  heartburn, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), high blood pressure  (hypertension), kidney problems, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or impairment of  the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (intestinal  pseudo-obstruction). html:p There are three types of systemic scleroderma, defined by the tissues affected  in the disorder. In one type of systemic scleroderma, known as limited cutaneous  systemic scleroderma, fibrosis usually affects only the hands, arms, and face.  Limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma used to be known as CREST syndrome, which  is named for the common features of the condition: calcinosis, Raynaud  phenomenon, esophageal motility dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.  In another type of systemic scleroderma, known as diffuse cutaneous systemic  scleroderma, the fibrosis affects large areas of skin, including the torso and  the upper arms and legs, and often involves internal organs. In diffuse  cutaneous systemic scleroderma, the condition worsens quickly and organ damage  occurs earlier than in other types of the condition. In the third type of  systemic scleroderma, called systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma ("sine"means  without in Latin), fibrosis affects one or more internal organs but not the  skin. html:p Approximately 15 percent to 25 percent of people with features of systemic  scleroderma also have signs and symptoms of another condition that affects  connective tissue, such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis,  Sjögren syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus. The combination of systemic  scleroderma with other connective tissue abnormalities is known as scleroderma  overlap syndrome.

frequency1: T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy is a rare disorder. It has been diagnosed in only a few individuals, almost all of whom are members of a large extended family from a community in southern Italy.
Description1: html:p T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy is a type of  severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is a group of disorders  characterized by an almost total lack of immune protection from foreign invaders  such as bacteria and viruses. People with this form of SCID are missing  functional immune cells called T cells, which normally recognize and attack  foreign invaders to prevent infection. Without functional T cells, affected  individuals develop repeated and persistent infections starting early in life.  The infections result inand can be life-threatening; without  effective treatment, most affected individuals live only into infancy or early  childhood. html:p T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy also affects  growth of the hair and nails. Congenital alopecia refers to an absence of hair  that is apparent from birth. Affected individuals have no scalp hair, eyebrows,  or eyelashes. Nail dystrophy is a general term that describes malformed  fingernails and toenails; in this condition, the nails are often ridged, pitted,  or abnormally curved. html:p Researchers have described abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord (central  nervous system) in at least two cases of this condition. However, it is not yet  known whether central nervous system abnormalities are a common feature of  T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy.

frequency1: Tangier disease is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases identified worldwide. More cases are likely undiagnosed. This condition is named after an island off the coast of Virginia where the first affected individuals were identified.
Description1: html:p Tangier disease is an inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced  levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the blood. HDL transports  cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids from the body's tissues to the  liver, where they are removed from the blood. HDL is often referred to as"good  cholesterol"because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of  developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Because people with  Tangier disease have very low levels of HDL, they have a moderately increased  risk of cardiovascular disease. html:p Additional signs and symptoms of Tangier disease include a slightly elevated  amount of fat in the blood (mild hypertriglyceridemia); disturbances in nerve  function (neuropathy); and enlarged, orange-colored tonsils. Affected  individuals often develop atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty  deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries. Other features of  this condition may include an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an enlarged liver  (hepatomegaly), clouding of the clear covering of the eye (corneal clouding),  and type 2 diabetes.

frequency1: This condition is very rare; however, the exact prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome is a rare, inherited bone disorder that affects  primarily the hands and feet. Several individual bones make up each wrist  (carpal bones) and ankle (tarsal bones). In tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome,  the carpal bones fuse together, as do the tarsal bones, which causes stiffness  and immobility of the hands and feet. Symptoms of the condition can become  apparent in infancy, and they worsen with age. The severity of the symptoms can  vary, even among members of the same family. html:p In this condition, fusion at the joints between the bones that make up each  finger and toe (symphalangism) can also occur. Consequently, the fingers and  toes become stiff and difficult to bend. Stiffness of the pinky fingers and toes  (fifth digits) is usually noticeable first. The joints at the base of the pinky  fingers and toes fuse first, and slowly, the other joints along the length of  these digits may also be affected. Progressively, the bones in the fourth,  third, and second digits (the ring finger, middle finger, and forefinger, and  the corresponding toes) become fused. The thumb and big toe are usually not  involved. Affected individuals have increasing trouble forming a fist, and  walking often becomes painful and difficult. Occasionally, there is also fusion  of bones in the upper and lower arm at the elbow joint (humeroradial fusion).  Less common features of tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome include

frequency1: Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome has been reported in approximately 30 families worldwide. Its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome is a rare condition  characterized by hearing loss, diabetes, and a blood disorder called  megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia occurs when a person has a low number  of red blood cells (anemia), and the remaining red blood cells are larger than  normal (megaloblastic). The symptoms of this blood disorder may include  decreased appetite, lack of energy, headaches, pale skin, diarrhea, and tingling  or numbness in the hands and feet. Individuals with thiamine-responsive  megaloblastic anemia syndrome begin to show symptoms of megaloblastic anemia  between infancy and adolescence. This syndrome is called"thiamine-responsive"  because the anemia can be treated with high doses of vitamin B1 (thiamine). html:p People with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome develop hearing  loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss)  during early childhood. It remains unclear whether thiamine treatment can  improve hearing or prevent hearing loss. html:p Diabetes becomes apparent in affected individuals sometime between infancy and  adolescence. Although these individuals develop diabetes during childhood, they  do not have the form of the disease that develops most often in children, called  type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes. People with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic  anemia syndrome usually require insulin to treat their diabetes. In some cases,  treatment with thiamine can reduce the amount of insulin a person needs. html:p Some individuals with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome develop  optic atrophy, which is the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that carry  information from the eyes to the brain. Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular)  problems such as heart rhythm abnormalities and s have also been  reported in some people with this syndrome.

Another 11 percent have moderately reduced</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">levels of TPMT activity that increase their risk of hematopoietic toxicity with</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">thiopurine drug treatment.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency is a condition characterized by</span>  significantly reduced activity of an enzyme that helps the body process drugs  called thiopurines. These drugs, which include 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine,  and azathioprine, inhibit (suppress) the body's immune system. Thiopurine drugs  are used to treat some autoimmune disorders, including Crohn disease and  rheumatoid arthritis, which occur when the immune system malfunctions. These  drugs are also used to treat several forms of cancer, particularly cancers of  blood-forming tissue (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas).  Additionally, thiopurine drugs are used in organ transplant recipients to help  prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted organ. html:p A potential complication of treatment with thiopurine drugs is damage to the  bone marrow (hematopoietic toxicity). Although this complication can occur in  anyone who takes these drugs, people with TPMT deficiency are at highest risk.  Bone marrow normally makes several types of blood cells, including red blood  cells, which carry oxygen; white blood cells, which help protect the body from  infection; and platelets, which are blood cell fragments that are are involved  in blood clotting. Damage to the bone marrow results in myelosuppression, a  condition in which the bone marrow is unable to make enough of these cells. A  shortage of red blood cells (anemia) can cause pale skin (pallor), weakness,  shortness of breath, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). Low numbers of white blood  cells (neutropenia) can lead to frequent and potentially life-threatening  infections. A shortage of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can cause easy bruising  and bleeding. html:p Many healthcare providers recommend that patients' TPMT activity levels be  tested before thiopurine drugs are prescribed. In people who are found to have  reduced enzyme activity, the drugs may be given at a significantly lower dose or  different medications can be used to reduce the risk of hematopoietic toxicity. html:p TPMT deficiency does not appear to cause any health problems other than those  associated with thiopurine drug treatment.

This platelet deficiency  (thrombocytopenia) usually appears during infancy and becomes less severe over  time; in some cases the platelet levels become normal. html:p Thrombocytopenia prevents normal blood clotting, resulting in easy bruising and  frequent nosebleeds. Potentially life-threatening episodes of severe bleeding  (hemorrhages) may occur in the brain and other organs, especially during the  first year of life. Hemorrhages can damage the brain and lead to  disability. Affected children who survive this period and do not have damaging  hemorrhages in the brain usually have a normal life expectancy and normal   html:p The severity of skeletal problems in TAR syndrome varies among affected  individuals. The radius, which is the bone on the thumb side of the forearm, is  almost always missing in both arms. The other bone in the forearm, which is  called the ulna, is sometimes underdeveloped or absent in one or both arms. TAR  syndrome is unusual among similar malformations in that affected individuals  have thumbs, while people with other conditions involving an absent radius  typically do not. However, there may be other abnormalities of the hands, such  as webbed or fused fingers (syndactyly) or curved pinky fingers (fifth finger  clinodactyly). Some people with TAR syndrome also have skeletal abnormalities  affecting the upper arms, legs, or hip sockets. html:p Other features that can occur in TAR syndrome include malformations of the heart  or kidneys. Some people with this disorder have unusual facial features  including a small lower jaw (micrognathia), a prominent forehead, and low-set  ears. About half of affected individuals have allergic reactions to cow's milk  that may worsen the thrombocytopenia associated with this disorder.

frequency1: The precise incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is unknown. Researchers estimate that, depending on geographic location, the condition <span style="background:#FFFF00;">affects 1.7 to 11 per million people each year in the United States. For</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">unknown reasons, the disorder occurs more frequently in women than in men. The</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">acquired form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is much more common than</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">the familial form.</span>
Description1: html:p Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare disorder that causes blood clots  (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can  cause serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to  organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. Resulting complications can  include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches,  confusion, and slurred ), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain,  and heart problems. html:p Blood clots normally form to prevent excess blood loss at the site of an injury.  In people with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, clots develop in blood  vessels even in the absence of injury. Blood clots are formed from clumps of  cell fragments called platelets, which circulate in the blood and assist with  clotting. Because a large number of platelets are used to make clots in people  with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, fewer platelets are available in the  bloodstream. A reduced level of circulating platelets is known as  thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia can lead to small areas of bleeding just  under the surface of the skin, resulting in purplish spots called purpura. html:p This disorder also causes red blood cells to break down (undergo hemolysis)  prematurely. As blood squeezes past clots within blood vessels, red blood cells  can break apart. A condition called hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells  are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads  to paleness, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of  breath, and a rapid heart rate. html:p There are two major forms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, an acquired  (noninherited) form and a familial form. The acquired form usually appears in  late childhood or adulthood. Affected individuals may have a single episode of  signs and symptoms, or they may recur over time. The familial form of this  disorder is much rarer and typically appears in infancy or early childhood. In  people with the familial form, signs and symptoms often recur on a regular  basis.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Tibial muscular dystrophy is a condition that affects the muscles at the front</span>  of the lower leg. The signs and symptoms of this condition typically appear  after age 35. The first sign is usually weakness and wasting (atrophy) of a  muscle in the lower leg called the tibialis anterior. This muscle helps control  up-and-down movement of the foot. Weakness in the tibialis anterior muscle makes  it difficult or impossible to walk on the heels, but it usually does not  interfere significantly with regular walking. html:p Muscle weakness worsens very slowly in people with tibial muscular dystrophy.  Ten to 20 years after the onset of symptoms, weakness may develop in muscles  that help extend the toes (long-toe extensors). Weakness in these muscles makes  it difficult to lift the toes while walking, a condition known as foot drop.  Later in life, about one third of people with tibial muscular dystrophy  experience mild to moderate difficulty with walking because of weakness in other  leg muscles. However, most affected individuals remain able to walk throughout  their lives. html:p A small percentage of people with tibial muscular dystrophy have a somewhat  different pattern of signs and symptoms than those described above. Starting in  childhood, these individuals may have generalized muscle weakness, weakness and  atrophy of the thigh muscles (quadriceps) or other muscles in the legs, and  weakness affecting muscles in the arms.

Description1: html:p Timothy syndrome is a rare disorder that affects many parts of the body  including the heart, digits (fingers and toes), and the nervous system. html:p Timothy syndrome is characterized by a heart condition called long QT syndrome,  which causes the heart (cardiac) muscle to take longer than usual to recharge  between beats. This abnormality in the heart's electrical system can cause  irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia), which can lead to sudden death. Many people  with Timothy syndrome are also born with structural s that affect  the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. As a result of these serious  heart problems, many people with Timothy syndrome live only into childhood. The  most common cause of death is a form of arrhythmia called ventricular  tachyarrhythmia, in which the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) beat  abnormally fast and lead to cardiac arrest. html:p Timothy syndrome is also characterized by webbing or fusion of the skin between  some fingers or toes (cutaneous syndactyly). About half of affected people have  distinctive facial features such as a flattened nasal bridge, low-set ears, a  small upper jaw, and a thin upper lip. Children with this condition have small,  misplaced teeth and frequent cavities (dental caries). Additional signs and  symptoms of Timothy syndrome can include baldness at birth, frequent infections,  episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and an abnormally low body  temperature (hypothermia). html:p Researchers have found that many children with Timothy syndrome have the  characteristic features of autism or similar conditions known as autistic  spectrum disorders. Affected children tend to have impaired  and  ization skills, as well as of  and .  Other nervous system abnormalities, including  disability and  , can also occur in children with Timothy syndrome. html:p Researchers have identified two forms of Timothy syndrome. Type 1, which is  also known as the classic type, includes all of the characteristic features  described above. Type 2, or the atypical type, causes a more severe form of long  QT syndrome and a greater risk of arrhythmia and sudden death. Unlike the  classic type, the atypical type does not appear to cause webbing of the fingers  or toes.

This disorder occurs in</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">populations and ethnic groups worldwide, and it is more common in males than in</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">females.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Tourette syndrome is a complex disorder characterized by repetitive, sudden, and</span>  involuntary movements or noises called tics. Tics usually appear in childhood,  and their severity varies over time. In most cases, tics become milder and  less frequent in late adolescence and adulthood. html:p Tourette syndrome involves both motor tics, which are uncontrolled body  movements, and vocal or phonic tics, which are outbursts of sound. Some motor  tics are simple and involve only one muscle group. Simple motor tics, such as  rapid eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, or nose twitching, are usually the first  signs of Tourette syndrome. Motor tics also can be complex (involving multiple  muscle groups), such as jumping, kicking, hopping, or spinning. html:p Vocal tics, which generally appear later than motor tics, also can be simple or  complex. Simple vocal tics include grunting, sniffing, and throat-clearing.  More complex vocalizations include repeating the words of others (echolalia) or  repeating one's own words (palilalia). The involuntary use of inappropriate or  obscene  (coprolalia) is possible, but uncommon, among people with  Tourette syndrome. html:p In addition to frequent tics, people with Tourette syndrome are at risk for  associated problems including  (),  obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), , , and problems with  sleep.

frequency1: The prevalence of transcobalamin deficiency is unknown. At least 45 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Transcobalamin deficiency is a disorder that impairs the transport of cobalamin  (also known as vitamin B12) within the body. Cobalamin is obtained from the  diet; this vitamin is found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and  shellfish. An inability to transport cobalamin within the body results in cells  that lack cobalamin, which they need for many functions including cell growth  and division (proliferation) and DNA production. The absence of cobalamin leads  to impaired, a shortage of blood cells, and many other signs and symptoms  that usually become apparent within the first weeks or months of life. html:p The first signs of transcobalamin deficiency are typically a failure to gain  weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), vomiting, diarrhea,  and open sores (ulcers) on the mucous membranes such as the lining inside the  mouth. Neurological function is impaired in affected individuals, and they can  experience progressive stiffness and weakness in their legs (paraparesis),  muscle twitches (myoclonus), or  disability. html:p People with transcobalamin deficiency often develop a blood disorder called  megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia results in a shortage of red blood  cells, and the remaining red blood cells are abnormally large. Individuals with  transcobalamin deficiency may also have a shortage of white blood cells  (neutropenia), which can lead to reduced immune system function. Decreased  cellular cobalamin can lead to a buildup of certain compounds in the body,  resulting in metabolic conditions known as methylmalonic aciduria or  homocystinuria.

It</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">is estimated that this form affects between 3 percent and 3.9 percent of African</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Americans and approximately 5 percent of people in some areas of West Africa.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Transthyretin amyloidosis is a slowly progressive condition characterized by the</span>  buildup of abnormal deposits of a protein called amyloid (amyloidosis) in the  body's organs and tissues. These protein deposits most frequently occur in the  peripheral nervous system, which is made up of nerves connecting the brain and  spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch,  pain, heat, and sound. Protein deposits in these nerves result in a loss of  sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy). The autonomic nervous  system, which controls involuntary body functions such as blood pressure, heart  rate, and digestion, may also be affected by amyloidosis. In some cases, the  brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) are affected. Other areas of  amyloidosis include the heart, kidneys, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. The  age at which symptoms begin to develop varies widely among individuals with this  condition, and is typically between ages 20 and 70. html:p There are three major forms of transthyretin amyloidosis, which are  distinguished by their symptoms and the body systems they affect. html:p The neuropathic form of transthyretin amyloidosis primarily affects the  peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, resulting in peripheral neuropathy and  difficulty controlling bodily functions. Impairments in bodily functions can  include sexual impotence, diarrhea, constipation, problems with urination, and a  sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension). Some  people experience heart and kidney problems as well. Various eye problems may  occur, such as cloudiness of the clear gel that fills the eyeball (vitreous  opacity), dry eyes, increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma), or pupils with an  irregular or"scalloped"appearance. Some people with this form of  transthyretin amyloidosis develop carpal tunnel syndrome, which is characterized  by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers. html:p The leptomeningeal form of transthyretin amyloidosis primarily affects the  central nervous system. In people with this form, amyloidosis occurs in the  leptomeninges, which are two thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and  spinal cord. A buildup of protein in this tissue can cause stroke and bleeding  in the brain, an accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), difficulty  s , muscle stiffness and weakness (spastic  paralysis), , and loss of  function (dementia). Eye  problems similar to those in the neuropathic form may also occur. When people  with leptomeningeal transthyretin amyloidosis have associated eye problems, they  are said to have the oculoleptomeningeal form. html:p The cardiac form of transthyretin amyloidosis affects the heart. People with  cardiac amyloidosis may have an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), an enlarged  heart (cardiomegaly), or orthostatic hypertension. These abnormalities can lead  to progressive heart failure and death. Occasionally, people with the cardiac  form of transthyretin amyloidosis have mild peripheral neuropathy.

frequency1: Trichohepatoenteric syndrome is a rare condition with an estimated prevalence of about 1 in 1 million people. At least 44 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Trichohepatoenteric syndrome is a condition that affects the hair (tricho-),  liver (hepato-), and intestines (enteric), as well as other tissues and organs  in the body. This condition is also known as syndromic diarrhea because chronic,  difficult-to-treat diarrhea is one of its major features. Within the first few  weeks of life, affected infants develop watery diarrhea that occurs multiple  times per day. Even with nutritional support through intravenous feedings  (parenteral nutrition), many of these children experience failure to thrive,  which means they do not gain weight or grow at the expected rate. Most children  with trichohepatoenteric syndrome are small at birth, and they remain shorter  than their peers throughout life. html:p Abnormal hair is another feature of trichohepatoenteric syndrome. Hair in  affected individuals is described as wooly, brittle, patchy, and easily pulled  out. Under a microscope, some strands of hair can be seen to vary in diameter,  with thicker and thinner spots. This feature is known as trichorrhexis nodosa. html:p Other signs and symptoms of trichohepatoenteric syndrome can include liver  disease; skin abnormalities; and distinctive facial features, including a wide  forehead, a broad base of the nose, and widely spaced eyes. Overall, the facial  features are described as"coarse."Most affected individuals also experience  immune system abnormalities that can make them prone to developing infections.  Less commonly, trichohepatoenteric syndrome is associated with heart (cardiac)  abnormalities. Mild  disability has been reported in at least half  of all children with the condition. html:p Trichohepatoenteric syndrome is often life-threatening in childhood,  particularly in children who develop liver disease or severe infections.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/triosephosphate-isomerase-deficiency
frequency1: Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is likely a rare condition; approximately 40 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.
Description1: html:p Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a disorder characterized by a shortage  of red blood cells (anemia), movement problems, increased susceptibility to  infection, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function. html:p The anemia in this condition begins in infancy. Since the anemia results from  the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic  anemia. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads  to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath.  When the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are  released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess  of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood  causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. html:p Movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with  triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. The movement problems are caused by  impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and  spinal cord that control muscle movement. This impairment leads to muscle  weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of  triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including  , s, and  (). Affected individuals may  also develop . html:p Weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as  cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity  (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency.  Diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to  respiratory failure. html:p Individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of  developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells.  These immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such  as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The most common infections in  people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the  respiratory tract. html:p People with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often do not survive past  childhood due to respiratory failure. In a few rare cases, affected individuals  without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood.

frequency1: Triple A syndrome is a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Triple A syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by three specific  features: achalasia, Addison disease, and alacrima. Achalasia is a disorder that  affects the ability to move food through the esophagus, the tube that carries  food from the throat to the stomach. It can lead to severe feeding difficulties  and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Addison disease, also known as primary  adrenal insufficiency, is caused by abnormal function of the small  hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands). The main  features of Addison disease include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, low  blood pressure, and darkening of the skin. The third major feature of triple A  syndrome is a reduced or absent ability to secrete tears (alacrima). Most people  with triple A syndrome have all three of these features, although some have  only two. html:p Many of the features of triple A syndrome are caused by dysfunction of the  autonomic nervous system. This part of the nervous system controls involuntary  body processes such as digestion, blood pressure, and body temperature. People  with triple A syndrome often experience abnormal sweating, difficulty regulating  blood pressure, unequal pupil size (anisocoria), and other signs and symptoms  of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (dysautonomia). html:p People with this condition may have other neurological abnormalities, such as  ,  problems (), and  a small head size (microcephaly). In addition, affected individuals commonly  experience muscle weakness, movement problems, and nerve abnormalities in their  extremities (peripheral neuropathy). Some develop optic atrophy, which is the  degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the  brain. Many of the neurological symptoms of triple A syndrome worsen over time. html:p People with triple A syndrome frequently develop a thickening of the outer layer  of skin (hyperkeratosis) on the palms of their hands and the soles of their  feet. Other skin abnormalities may also be present in people with this  condition. html:p Alacrima is usually the first noticeable sign of triple A syndrome, as it  becomes apparent early in life that affected children produce little or no tears  while crying. They develop Addison disease and achalasia during childhood or  adolescence, and most of the neurologic features of triple A syndrome begin  during adulthood. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected  individuals, even among members of the same family.

frequency1: TRNT1 deficiency is a rare condition; its prevalence is unknown. Approximately 20 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p TRNT1 deficiency is a condition that affects many body systems. Its signs and  symptoms can involve blood cells, the immune system, the eyes, and the nervous  system. The severity of the signs and symptoms vary widely. html:p A common feature of TRNT1 deficiency is a blood condition called sideroblastic  anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). In  TRNT1 deficiency, the red blood cells that are present are unusually small  (erythrocytic microcytosis). In addition, developing red blood cells in the bone  marrow (erythroblasts) can have an abnormal buildup of iron that appears as a  ring of blue staining in the cell after treatment in the lab with certain dyes.  These abnormal cells are called ring sideroblasts. html:p Many people with TRNT1 deficiency have an immune system disorder  (immunodeficiency) that can lead to recurrent bacterial infections. Repeated  infections can cause life-threatening damage to internal organs. The  immunodeficiency is characterized by low numbers of immune system cells called B  cells, which normally help fight infections by producing immune proteins called  antibodies (or immunoglobulins). These proteins target foreign invaders such as  bacteria and viruses and mark them for destruction. In many individuals with  TRNT1 deficiency, the amount of immunoglobulins is also low  (hypogammaglobulinemia). html:p In addition, many individuals with TRNT1 deficiency have recurrent fevers that  are not caused by an infection. These fever episodes are often one of the  earliest recognized symptoms of TRNT1 deficiency, usually beginning in infancy.  The fever episodes are typically accompanied by poor feeding, vomiting, and  diarrhea, and can lead to hospitalization. In many affected individuals, the  episodes occur regularly, arising approximately every 2 to 4 weeks and lasting 5  to 7 days, although the frequency can decrease with age. html:p Eye abnormalities, often involving the light-sensing tissue at the back of the  eye (the retina), can occur in people with TRNT1 deficiency. Some of these  individuals have a condition called retinitis pigmentosa, in which the  light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Eye problems in TRNT1  deficiency can lead to vision loss. html:p Neurological problems are also frequent in TRNT1 deficiency. Many affected  individuals have   html:p Features that occur less commonly in people with TRNT1 deficiency include  hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing  loss), recurrent  (), and problems with the kidneys or heart. html:p TRNT1 deficiency encompasses what was first thought to be two separate  disorders, a severe disorder called sideroblastic anemia with B-cell  immunodeficiency, periodic fevers, and (SIFD) and a milder  disorder called retinitis pigmentosa with erythrocytic microcytosis (RPEM), each  named for its most common features. SIFD begins in infancy, and affected  individuals usually do not survive past childhood. RPEM, on the other hand, is  recognized in early adulthood, and the microcytosis usually does not cause any  health problems. However, it has since been recognized that some individuals  have a combination of features that fall between these two ends of the severity  spectrum. All of these cases are now considered part of TRNT1 deficiency.

Hereditary spastic paraplegias are divided into two types: pure  and complex. The pure types involve the lower limbs. The complex types involve  the lower limbs and can also affect the upper limbs to a lesser degree; the  structure or functioning of the brain; and the nerves connecting the brain and  spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch,  pain, heat, and sound (the peripheral nervous system). Troyer syndrome is a  complex hereditary spastic paraplegia. html:p People with Troyer syndrome can experience a variety of signs and symptoms. The  most common characteristics of Troyer syndrome are of the leg  muscles, progressive muscle weakness, paraplegia, muscle wasting in the hands  and feet (distal amyotrophy), , ,  disorders,  difficulties (), and mood swings. Other  characteristics can include exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) in the lower  limbs, uncontrollable movements of the limbs (choreoathetosis), skeletal  abnormalities, and a bending outward (valgus) of the knees. html:p Troyer syndrome causes the degeneration and death of muscle cells and motor  neurons (specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement) throughout a  person's lifetime, leading to a slow progressive decline in muscle and nerve  function. The severity of impairment related to Troyer syndrome increases as a  person ages. Most affected individuals require a wheelchair by the time they  are in their fifties or sixties.

Type II fibers, also known as fast twitch fibers, are used for short  bursts of strength, which are needed for activities such as running up stairs or  sprinting. In people with tubular aggregate myopathy, type II fibers waste away  (atrophy), so affected individuals have mostly type I fibers. In addition,  proteins build up abnormally in both type I and type II fibers, forming clumps  of tube-like structures called tubular aggregates. Tubular aggregates can occur  in other muscle disorders, but they are the primary muscle cell abnormality in  tubular aggregate myopathy.

frequency1: TRAPS has an estimated prevalence of one per million individuals; it is the second most common inherited recurrent fever syndrome, following a similar condition called familial Mediterranean fever. More than 1,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with TRAPS.
Description1: html:p Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (commonly known as  TRAPS) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. These fevers  typically last about 3 weeks but can last from a few days to a few months. The  frequency of the episodes varies greatly among affected individuals; fevers can  occur anywhere between every 6 weeks to every few years. Some individuals can  go many years without having a fever episode. Fever episodes usually occur  spontaneously, but sometimes they can be brought on by a variety of triggers,  such as minor injury, infection, stress, exercise, or hormonal changes. html:p During episodes of fever, people with TRAPS can have additional signs and  symptoms. These include abdominal and muscle pain and a spreading skin rash,  typically found on the limbs. Affected individuals may also experience puffiness  or swelling in the skin around the eyes (periorbital edema); joint pain; and  inflammation in various areas of the body including the eyes, heart muscle,  certain joints, throat, or mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the  mouth and digestive tract. Occasionally, people with TRAPS develop amyloidosis,  an abnormal buildup of a protein called amyloid in the kidneys that can lead to  kidney failure. It is estimated that 15 to 20 percent of people with TRAPS  develop amyloidosis, typically in mid-adulthood. html:p The fever episodes characteristic of TRAPS can begin at any age, from infancy to  late adulthood, but most people have their first episode in childhood.

frequency1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Type 1 diabetes occurs in 10 to 20 per 100,000 people per year in the</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">United States. By age 18, approximately 1 in 300 people in the United States</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">develop type 1 diabetes. The disorder occurs with similar frequencies in Europe,</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand. Type 1 diabetes occurs much less</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">frequently in Asia and South America, with reported incidences as low as 1 in 1</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">million per year. For unknown reasons, during the past 20 years the worldwide</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">incidence of type 1 diabetes has been increasing by 2 to 5 percent each</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">year.Type 1 diabetes accounts for 5 to 10 percent of cases of diabetes</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">worldwide. Most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, in which the body</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">continues to produce insulin but becomes less able to use it.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Type 1 diabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar</span>  levels. In this form of diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas called beta  cells stop producing insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of  sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. Lack of  insulin results in the inability to use glucose for energy or to control the  amount of sugar in the blood. html:p Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age; however, it usually develops by early  adulthood, most often starting in adolescence. The first signs and symptoms of  the disorder are caused by high blood sugar and may include frequent urination  (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or  loss of feeling in the hands and feet, and weight loss. These symptoms may recur  during the course of the disorder if blood sugar is not well controlled by  insulin replacement therapy. Improper control can also cause blood sugar levels  to become too low (hypoglycemia). This may occur when the body's needs change,  such as during exercise or if eating is delayed. Hypoglycemia can cause  headache, dizziness, hunger, , sweating, weakness, and agitation. html:p Uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can lead to a life-threatening complication called  diabetic ketoacidosis. Without insulin, cells cannot take in glucose. A lack of  glucose in cells prompts the liver to try to compensate by releasing more  glucose into the blood, and blood sugar can become extremely high. The cells,  unable to use the glucose in the blood for energy, respond by using fats  instead. Breaking down fats to obtain energy produces waste products called  ketones, which can build up to toxic levels in people with type 1 diabetes,  resulting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Affected individuals may begin breathing  rapidly; develop a fruity odor in the breath; and experience nausea, vomiting,  facial flushing, stomach pain, and dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). In severe  cases, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death. html:p Over many years, the chronic high blood sugar associated with diabetes may cause  damage to blood vessels and nerves, leading to complications affecting many  organs and tissues. The retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back  of the eye, can be damaged (diabetic retinopathy), leading to vision loss and  eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) may also occur and can  lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pain, tingling, and  loss of normal sensation (diabetic neuropathy) often occur, especially in the  feet. Impaired circulation and absence of the normal sensations that prompt  reaction to injury can result in permanent damage to the feet; in severe cases,  the damage can lead to amputation. People with type 1 diabetes are also at  increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and problems with urinary and sexual  function.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Type 2 diabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar</span>  levels. In this form of diabetes, the body stops using and making insulin  properly. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate  blood sugar levels. Specifically, insulin controls how much glucose (a type of  sugar) is passed from the blood into cells, where it is used as an energy  source. When blood sugar levels are high (such as after a meal), the pancreas  releases insulin to move the excess glucose into cells, which reduces the amount  of glucose in the blood. html:p Most people who develop type 2 diabetes first have insulin resistance, a  condition in which the body's cells use insulin less efficiently than normal. As  insulin resistance develops, more and more insulin is needed to keep blood  sugar levels in the normal range. To keep up with the increasing need,  insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (called beta cells) make larger amounts  of insulin. Over time, the beta cells become less able to respond to blood sugar  changes, leading to an insulin shortage that prevents the body from reducing  blood sugar levels effectively. Most people have some insulin resistance as they  age, but inadequate exercise and excessive weight gain make it worse, greatly  increasing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. html:p Type 2 diabetes can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age  or later. Signs and symptoms develop slowly over years. They include frequent  urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision,  tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet (diabetic neuropathy), sores  that do not heal well, and weight loss. If blood sugar levels are not controlled  through medication or diet, type 2 diabetes can cause long-lasting (chronic)  health problems including heart disease and stroke; nerve damage; and damage to  the kidneys, eyes, and other parts of the body.

Description1: html:p Type A insulin resistance syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe  insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's tissues and organs do not  respond properly to the hormone insulin. Insulin normally helps regulate blood  sugar levels by controlling how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed  from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. In people with type A  insulin resistance syndrome, insulin resistance impairs blood sugar regulation  and ultimately leads to a condition called diabetes mellitus, in which blood  sugar levels can become dangerously high. html:p Severe insulin resistance also underlies the other signs and symptoms of type A  insulin resistance syndrome. In affected females, the major features of the  condition become apparent in adolescence. Many affected females do not begin  menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea) or their periods may be light and  irregular (oligomenorrhea). They develop cysts on the ovaries and excessive body  hair growth (hirsutism). Most affected females also develop a skin condition  called acanthosis nigricans, in which the skin in body folds and creases becomes  thick, dark, and velvety. Unlike most people with insulin resistance, females  with type A insulin resistance syndrome are usually not overweight. html:p The features of type A insulin resistance syndrome are more subtle in affected  males. Some males have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) as the only sign; others  may also have acanthosis nigricans. In many cases, males with this condition  come to medical attention only when they develop diabetes mellitus in adulthood. html:p Type A insulin resistance syndrome is one of a group of related conditions  described as inherited severe insulin resistance syndromes. These disorders,  which also include Donohue syndrome and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, are  considered part of a spectrum. Type A insulin resistance syndrome represents the  mildest end of the spectrum: its features often do not become apparent until  puberty or later, and it is generally not life-threatening.

Description1: html:p Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency is a disorder that primarily affects  movement, with symptoms that may range from mild to severe. html:p The mild form of this disorder is called TH-deficient  . Symptoms usually appear during childhood. Affected individuals may  exhibit unusual limb positioning and a lack of coordination when walking or  running. In some cases, people with TH-deficient DRD have additional movement  problems such as or  involuntary upward-rolling movements of the eyes. The movement difficulties may  slowly increase with age but almost always get better with medical treatment. html:p The severe forms of TH deficiency are called infantile parkinsonism and  progressive infantile encephalopathy. These forms of the disorder appear soon  after birth and are more difficult to treat effectively. html:p Babies with infantile parkinsonism have  . They may have stiff muscles,  especially in the arms and legs; unusual body positioning; droopy eyelids  (ptosis); and involuntary upward-rolling eye movements. The autonomic nervous  system, which controls involuntary body functions, may also be affected.  Resulting signs and symptoms can include constipation, backflow of stomach acids  into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux), and difficulty regulating blood  sugar, body temperature, and blood pressure. People with the infantile  parkinsonism form of the disorder may have  disability,  problems, , and  conditions such as  , , or obsessive-compulsive behaviors. html:p Progressive infantile encephalopathy is an uncommon severe form of TH  deficiency. It is characterized by brain dysfunction and structural  abnormalities leading to profound physical and  disability.

This type is more common in Norway where 1 in 60,000 to 74,000 individuals are <span style="background:#FFFF00;">affected. Tyrosinemia type I is even more common in Quebec, Canada where it</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">occurs in about 1 in 16,000 individuals.

Tyrosinemia type III is very rare; only a few cases have been reported.
Description1: html:p Tyrosinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by disruptions in the multistep  process that breaks down the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most  proteins. If untreated, tyrosine and its byproducts build up in tissues and  organs, which can lead to serious health problems. html:p There are three types of tyrosinemia, which are each distinguished by their  symptoms and genetic cause. Tyrosinemia type I, the most severe form of this  disorder, is characterized by signs and symptoms that begin in the first few  months of life. Affected infants fail to gain weight and grow at the expected  rate (failure to thrive) due to poor food tolerance because high-protein foods  lead to diarrhea and vomiting. Affected infants may also have yellowing of the  skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), a cabbage-like odor, and an increased  tendency to bleed (particularly nosebleeds). Tyrosinemia type I can lead to  liver and kidney failure, softening and weakening of the bones (rickets), and an  increased risk of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Some affected  children have repeated neurologic crises that consist of changes in mental  state, reduced sensation in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), abdominal  pain, and respiratory failure. These crises can last from 1 to 7 days.  Untreated, children with tyrosinemia type I often do not survive past the age of  10 html:p Tyrosinemia type II can affect the eyes, skin, and mental development. Signs and  symptoms often begin in early childhood and include eye pain and redness,  excessive tearing, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), and thick,  painful skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar  hyperkeratosis). About 50 percent of individuals with tyrosinemia type II have  some degree of  disability. html:p Tyrosinemia type III is the rarest of the three types. The characteristic  features of this type include  disability, , and periodic  loss of balance and coordination (intermittent ataxia). html:p About 10 percent of newborns have temporarily elevated levels of tyrosine  (transient tyrosinemia). In these cases, the cause is not genetic. The most  likely causes are vitamin C deficiency or immature liver enzymes due to  premature birth.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disorder that affects the digestive system. This</span>  condition is characterized by abnormal inflammation of the inner surface of the  rectum and colon, which make up most of the length of the large intestine. The  inflammation usually causes open sores (ulcers) to develop in the large  intestine. Ulcerative colitis usually appears between ages 15 and 30, although  it can develop at any age. The inflammation tends to flare up multiple times  throughout life, which causes recurring signs and symptoms. html:p The most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis are abdominal pain and cramping  and frequent diarrhea, often with blood, pus, or mucus in the stool. Other signs  and symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, and fevers. Chronic  bleeding from the inflamed and ulcerated intestinal tissue can cause a shortage  of red blood cells (anemia) in some affected individuals. People with this  disorder have difficulty absorbing enough fluids and nutrients from their diet  and often experience weight loss. Affected children usually grow more slowly  than normal. Less commonly, ulcerative colitis causes problems with the skin,  joints, eyes, kidneys, or liver, which are most likely due to abnormal  inflammation. html:p Toxic megacolon is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis that can be  life-threatening. Toxic megacolon involves widening of the colon and an  overwhelming bacterial infection (sepsis). Ulcerative colitis also increases the  risk of developing colon cancer, especially in people whose entire colon is  inflamed and in people who have had ulcerative colitis for 8 or more years. html:p Ulcerative colitis is one common form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  Another type of IBD, Crohn disease, also causes chronic inflammation of the  intestines. Unlike ulcerative colitis, which affects only the inner surface of  the large intestine, Crohn disease can cause inflammation in any part of the  digestive system, and the inflammation extends deeper into the intestinal  tissue.

Description1: html:p Usher syndrome is a condition characterized by partial or total hearing loss and  vision loss that worsens over time. The hearing loss is classified as  sensorineural, which means that it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear.  The loss of vision is caused by an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP),  which affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the  retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually  deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that  develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge  and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases, vision is further impaired by  clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). However, many people with  retinitis pigmentosa retain some central vision throughout their lives. html:p Researchers have identified three major types of Usher syndrome, designated as  types I, II, and III. These types are distinguished by the severity of hearing  loss, the presence or absence of balance problems, and the age at which signs  and symptoms appear. The types are further divided into subtypes based on their  genetic cause. html:p Most individuals with Usher syndrome type I are born with severe to profound  hearing loss. Progressive vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa becomes  apparent in childhood. This type of Usher syndrome also causes abnormalities of  the vestibular system, which is the part of the inner ear that helps maintain  the body's balance and orientation in space. As a result of the vestibular  abnormalities, children with the condition have trouble with balance. They begin  sitting independently and walking later than usual, and they may have  difficulty riding a bicycle and playing certain sports. html:p Usher syndrome type II is characterized by hearing loss from birth and  progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. The hearing  loss associated with this form of Usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and  mainly affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds. For example, it is  difficult for affected individuals to hear high, soft  sounds, such as  those of the letters d and t. The degree of hearing loss varies within and among  families with this condition, and it may become more severe over time. Unlike  the other forms of Usher syndrome, type II is not associated with vestibular  abnormalities that cause difficulties with balance. html:p People with Usher syndrome type III experience hearing loss and vision loss  beginning somewhat later in life. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, type  III is usually associated with normal hearing at birth. Hearing loss typically  begins during late childhood or adolescence, after the development of ,  and becomes more severe over time. By middle age, most affected individuals have  profound hearing loss. Vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa also develops  in late childhood or adolescence. Some people with Usher syndrome type III  develop vestibular abnormalities that cause problems with balance.

Affected individuals may have additional abnormalities that are not among the  characteristic features of VACTERL association. html:p Defects in the bones of the spine (vertebrae) are present in 60 to 80 percent of  people with VACTERL association. These defects may include misshapen vertebrae,  fused vertebrae, and missing or extra vertebrae. In some people, spinal  problems require surgery or cause health problems, such as back pain of varying  severity, throughout life. Sixty to 90 percent of individuals with VACTERL  association have narrowing or blockage of the anus (anal atresia). Anal atresia  may be accompanied by abnormalities of urinary tract  (genitourinary anomalies). Heart (cardiac) defects occur in 40 to 80 percent of  individuals with VACTERL association. Cardiac defects can range in severity from  a life-threatening problem to a subtle defect that does not cause health  problems. Fifty to 80 percent of people with VACTERL association have a  tracheo-esophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection (fistula) between  the esophagus and the windpipe (trachea). Tracheo-esophageal fistula can cause  problems with breathing and feeding early in life and typically requires  surgical correction in infancy. Kidney (renal) anomalies occur in 50 to 80  percent of individuals with VACTERL association. Affected individuals may be  missing one or both kidneys or have abnormally developed or misshapen kidneys,  which can affect kidney function. Limb abnormalities are seen in 40 to 50  percent of people with VACTERL association. These abnormalities most commonly  include poorly developed or missing thumbs or underdeveloped forearms and hands. html:p Some of the features of VACTERL association can be subtle and are not identified  until late in childhood or adulthood, making diagnosis of this condition  difficult.

The weak bones  often cause bone pain and and have a tendency to fracture. When  affected children begin to walk, they may develop abnormally curved (bowed) legs  because the bones are too weak to bear weight. Also  results in widening of the areas near the ends of bones where new bone forms  (metaphyses), especially in the knees, wrists, and ribs. Some people with  vitamin D-dependent rickets have dental abnormalities such as thin tooth enamel  and frequent cavities. Poor muscle tone () and muscle weakness are also  common in this condition, and some affected individuals develop . html:p In vitamin D-dependent rickets, there is an imbalance of certain substances in  the blood. An early sign in all types of the condition is low levels of the  mineral calcium (hypocalcemia), which is essential for the normal formation of  bones and teeth. Affected individuals also develop high levels of a hormone  involved in regulating calcium levels called parathyroid hormone (PTH), which  leads to a condition called secondary hyperparathyroidism. Low levels of a  mineral called phosphate (hypophosphatemia) also occur in affected individuals.  Vitamin D-dependent rickets types 1 and 2 can be grouped by blood levels of a  hormone called calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D; individuals  with VDDR1A and VDDR1B have abnormally low levels of calcitriol and individuals  with VDDR2A and VDDR2B have abnormally high levels. html:p Hair loss (alopecia) can occur in VDDR2A, although not everyone with this form  of the condition has alopecia.

frequency1: Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a genetic eye disorder that can cause  progressive vision loss. This disorder affects the retina, the specialized  light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically,  vitelliform macular dystrophy disrupts cells in a small area near the center of  the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central  vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and  recognizing faces. html:p Vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to  build up in cells underlying the macula. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of  this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As  a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their  eyesight may become blurry or distorted. Vitelliform macular dystrophy  typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at  night. html:p Researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with  similar features. The early-onset form (known as Best disease) usually appears  in childhood; the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely.  The adult-onset form begins later, usually in mid-adulthood, and tends to  cause vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The two forms of vitelliform  macular dystrophy each have characteristic changes in the macula that can be  detected during an eye examination.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Vitiligo is a condition that causes patchy loss of skin coloring (pigmentation).</span>  The average age of onset of vitiligo is in the mid-twenties, but it can appear  at any age. It tends to progress over time, with larger areas of the skin losing  pigment. Some people with vitiligo also have patches of pigment loss affecting  the hair on their scalp or body. html:p Researchers have identified several forms of vitiligo. Generalized vitiligo  (also called nonsegmental vitiligo), which is the most common form, involves  loss of pigment (depigmentation) in patches of skin all over the body.  Depigmentation typically occurs on the face, neck, and scalp, and around body  openings such as the mouth and genitals. Sometimes pigment is lost in mucous  membranes, such as the lips. Loss of pigmentation is also frequently seen in  areas that tend to experience rubbing, impact, or other trauma, such as the  hands, arms, and places where bones are close to the skin surface (bony  prominences). Another form called segmental vitiligo is associated with smaller  patches of depigmented skin that appear on one side of the body in a limited  area; this occurs in about 10 percent of affected individuals. html:p Vitiligo is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune  disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and  organs. In people with vitiligo the immune system appears to attack the pigment  cells (melanocytes) in the skin. About 15 to 25 percent of people with vitiligo  are also affected by at least one other autoimmune disorder, particularly  autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis,  pernicious anemia, Addison disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus. html:p In the absence of other autoimmune conditions, vitiligo does not affect general  health or physical functioning. However, concerns about appearance and ethnic  identity are significant issues for many affected individuals.

frequency1: Vohwinkel syndrome is a rare disorder; about 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
Description1: html:p Vohwinkel syndrome is a disorder with classic and variant forms, both of which  affect the skin. html:p In the classic form of Vohwinkel syndrome, affected individuals have thick,  honeycomb-like calluses on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet  (palmoplantar keratoses) beginning in infancy or early childhood. Affected  children also typically have distinctive starfish-shaped patches of thickened  skin on the tops of the fingers and toes or on the knees. Within a few years  they develop tight bands of abnormal fibrous tissue around their fingers and  toes (pseudoainhum); the bands may cut off the circulation to the digits and  result in spontaneous amputation. People with the classic form of the disorder  also have hearing loss. html:p The variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome does not involve hearing loss, and the  skin features also include widespread dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis), especially  on the limbs. The ichthyosis is usually mild, and there may also be mild  reddening of the skin (erythroderma). Some affected infants are born with a  tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. This  membrane is usually shed during the first few weeks of life.

frequency1: The incidence of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 36,000 individuals.
Description1: html:p Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by the  formation of tumors and fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in many different parts of the  body. Tumors may be either noncancerous or cancerous and most frequently appear  during young adulthood; however, the signs and symptoms of von Hippel-Lindau  syndrome can occur throughout life. html:p Tumors called hemangioblastomas are characteristic of von Hippel-Lindau  syndrome. These growths are made of newly formed blood vessels. Although they  are typically noncancerous, they can cause serious or life-threatening  complications. Hemangioblastomas that develop in the brain and spinal cord can  cause headaches, vomiting, weakness, and a  Hemangioblastomas can also occur in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the  back of the eye (the retina). These tumors, which are also called retinal  angiomas, may cause vision loss. html:p People with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome commonly develop cysts in the kidneys,  pancreas, and genital tract. They are also at an increased risk of developing a  type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal cell carcinoma and a type of  pancreatic cancer called a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. html:p Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is associated with a type of tumor called a  pheochromocytoma, which most commonly occurs in the adrenal glands (small  hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). Pheochromocytomas are  usually noncancerous. They may cause no symptoms, but in some cases they are  associated with headaches, panic attacks, excess sweating, or dangerously high  blood pressure that may not respond to medication. Pheochromocytomas are  particularly dangerous if they develop during pregnancy. html:p About 10 percent of people with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome develop endolymphatic  sac tumors, which are noncancerous tumors in the inner ear. These growths can  cause hearing loss in one or both ears, as well as ringing in the ears  (tinnitus) and problems with balance. Without treatment, these tumors can cause  sudden profound deafness.

Most</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">researchers agree that von Willebrand disease is the most common genetic</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">bleeding disorder.</span>
Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting</span>  process, causing prolonged bleeding after an injury. People with this condition  often experience easy bruising, long-lasting nosebleeds, and excessive bleeding  or oozing following an injury, surgery, or dental work. Mild forms of von  Willebrand disease may become apparent only when abnormal bleeding occurs  following surgery or a serious injury. Women with this condition typically have  heavy or prolonged bleeding during menstruation (menorrhagia), and some may also  experience reproductive tract bleeding during pregnancy and childbirth. In  severe cases of von Willebrand disease, heavy bleeding occurs after minor trauma  or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Symptoms of von  Willebrand disease may change over time. Increased age, pregnancy, exercise, and  stress may cause bleeding symptoms to become less frequent. html:p Von Willebrand disease is divided into three types, with type 2 being further  divided into four subtypes. Type 1 is the mildest and most common of the three  types, accounting for 75 percent of affected individuals. Type 3 is the most  severe and rarest form of the condition. The four subtypes of type 2 von  Willebrand disease are intermediate in severity. Another form of the disorder,  acquired von Willebrand syndrome, is not caused by inherited gene mutations.  Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is typically seen along with other disorders,  such as diseases that affect bone marrow or immune cell function. This rare form  of the condition is characterized by abnormal bleeding into the skin and other  soft tissues, usually beginning in adulthood.

Description1: loss and changes in coloring (pigmentation) of the hair, skin, and eyes.  Although most people with Waardenburg syndrome have normal hearing, moderate to  profound hearing loss can occur in one or both ears. The hearing loss is present  from birth (congenital). People with this condition often have very pale blue  eyes or different colored eyes, such as one blue eye and one brown eye.  Sometimes one eye has segments of two different colors. Distinctive hair  coloring (such as a patch of white hair or hair that prematurely turns gray) is  another common sign of the condition. The features of Waardenburg syndrome vary  among affected individuals, even among people in the same family. html:p There are four recognized types of Waardenburg syndrome, which are distinguished  by their physical characteristics and sometimes by their genetic cause. Types I  and II have very similar features, although people with type I almost always  have eyes that appear widely spaced and people with type II do not. In addition,  hearing loss occurs more often in people with type II than in those with type  I. Type III (sometimes called Klein-Waardenburg syndrome) includes abnormalities  of the arms and hands in addition to hearing loss and changes in pigmentation.  Type IV (also known as Waardenburg-Shah syndrome) has signs and symptoms of both  Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung disease, an intestinal disorder that  causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine.

Description1: html:p Wagner syndrome is a hereditary disorder that causes progressive vision loss.  The eye problems that lead to vision loss typically begin in childhood, although  the vision impairment might not be immediately apparent. html:p In people with Wagner syndrome, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back  of the eye (the retina) becomes thin and may separate from the back of the eye  (retinal detachment). The blood vessels within the retina (known as the choroid)  may also be abnormal. The retina and the choroid progressively break down  (degenerate). Some people with Wagner syndrome have blurred vision because of  ectopic fovea, an abnormality in which the part of the retina responsible for  sharp central vision is out of place. Additionally, the thick, clear gel that  fills the eyeball (the vitreous) becomes watery and thin. People with Wagner  syndrome develop a clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract). Affected  individuals may also experience nearsightedness (myopia), progressive night  blindness, or a narrowing of their field of vision. html:p Vision impairment in people with Wagner syndrome can vary from near normal  vision to complete loss of vision in both eyes.

Description1: html:p WAGR syndrome is a disorder that affects many body systems and is named for its  main features: Wilms tumor, anirida, genitourinary anomalies, and  disability (formerly referred to as mental retardation). html:p People with WAGR syndrome have a 45 to 60 percent chance of developing Wilms  tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer. This type of cancer is most often diagnosed  in children but is sometimes seen in adults. html:p Most people with WAGR syndrome have aniridia, an absence of the colored part of  the eye (the iris). This can cause reduction in the sharpness of vision (visual  acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Aniridia is typically  the first noticeable sign of WAGR syndrome. Other eye problems may also develop,  such as clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), increased pressure in the  eyes (glaucoma), and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). html:p Abnormalities of the urinary tract  are  seen more frequently in males with WAGR syndrome than in affected females. The  most common genitourinary anomaly in affected males is undescended testes  (cryptorchidism). Females may not have functional ovaries and instead have  undeveloped clumps of tissue called streak gonads. Females may also have a  heart-shaped (bicornate) uterus, which makes it difficult to carry a pregnancy  to term. html:p Another common feature of WAGR syndrome is  disability. Affected  individuals often have difficulty processing, , and properly responding  to information. Some individuals with WAGR syndrome also have  or  problems including , ,  , obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or a    interaction. html:p Other signs and symptoms of WAGR syndrome can include childhood-onset obesity,  inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), and kidney failure.

frequency1: Waldenström macroglobulinemia affects an estimated 3 per million people <span style="background:#FFFF00;">each year in the United States. Approximately 1,500 new cases of the condition</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">are diagnosed each year in this country, and whites are more commonly affected</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">than African Americans. For unknown reasons, the condition occurs twice as often</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">in men than women.</span>
Description1: html:p Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a rare blood cell cancer characterized by an  excess of abnormal white blood cells called lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone  marrow. This condition is classified as a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The  abnormal cells have characteristics of both white blood cells (lymphocytes)  called B cells and of more mature cells derived from B cells known as plasma  cells. These abnormal cells produce excess amounts of IgM, a type of protein  known as an immunoglobulin; the overproduction of this large protein is how the  condition got its name ("macroglobulinemia"). html:p Waldenström macroglobulinemia usually begins in a person's sixties and is a  slow-growing (indolent) cancer. Some affected individuals have elevated levels  of IgM and lymphoplasmacytic cells but no symptoms of the condition; in these  cases, the disease is usually found incidentally by a blood test taken for  another reason. These individuals are diagnosed with smoldering (or  asymptomatic) Waldenström macroglobulinemia. It can be several years before this  form of the condition progresses to the symptomatic form. html:p Individuals with symptomatic Waldenström macroglobulinemia can experience  general symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Several other  signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the excess IgM, which can  thicken blood and impair circulation, causing a condition known as  hyperviscosity syndrome. Features related to hyperviscosity syndrome include  bleeding in the nose or mouth, blurring or loss of vision, headache, dizziness,  and difficulty s . In some affected individuals,  the IgM proteins clump together in the hands and feet, where the body  temperature is cooler than at the center of the body. These proteins are then  referred to as cryoglobulins, and their clumping causes a condition known as  cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulinemia can lead to pain in the hands and feet or  episodes of Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers and toes turn white or blue  in response to cold temperatures. The IgM protein can also build up in organs  such as the heart and kidneys, causing a condition called amyloidosis, which can  lead to heart and kidney problems. Some people with Waldenström  macroglobulinemia develop a loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs  (peripheral neuropathy). Doctors are unsure why this feature occurs, although  they speculate that the IgM protein attaches to the protective covering of nerve  cells (myelin) and breaks it down. The damaged nerves cannot carry signals  normally, leading to neuropathy. html:p Other features of Waldenström macroglobulinemia are due to the accumulation of  lymphoplasmacytic cells in different tissues. For example, accumulation of these  cells can lead to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or  lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). In the bone marrow, the lymphoplasmacytic cells    . Excessive tiredness (fatigue) due to a reduction in red  blood cells (anemia) is common in affected individuals. html:p People with Waldenström macroglobulinemia have an increased risk of developing  other cancers of the blood or other tissues.

These individuals  may also have a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) or abnormalities  of certain parts of the brain, including a region called the cerebellum and the  part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord (the brainstem). These  changes in the structure of the brain lead to significantly  . Some individuals with Walker-Warburg syndrome  experience . html:p Eye abnormalities are also characteristic of Walker-Warburg syndrome. These can  include unusually small eyeballs (microphthalmia), enlarged eyeballs caused by  increased pressure in the eyes (buphthalmos), clouding of the lenses of the eyes  (cataracts), and problems with the nerve that relays visual information from  the eyes to the brain (the optic nerve). These eye problems lead to vision  impairment in affected individuals.

GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/warfarin-resistance
frequency1: Warfarin resistance is thought to be a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown.
Description1: html:p Warfarin resistance is a condition in which individuals have a high tolerance  for the drug warfarin. Warfarin is an anticoagulant, which means that it thins  the blood, preventing blood clots from forming. Warfarin is often prescribed to  prevent blood clots in people with heart valve disease who have replacement  heart valves, people with an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation), or  those with a history of heart attack, stroke, or a prior blood clot in the deep  veins of the arms or legs (deep vein thrombosis). html:p There are two types of warfarin resistance: incomplete and complete. Those with  incomplete warfarin resistance can achieve the benefits of warfarin treatment  with a high dose of warfarin. Individuals with complete warfarin resistance do  not respond to warfarin treatment, no matter how high the dose. If people with  warfarin resistance require treatment with warfarin and take the average dose,  they will remain at risk of developing a potentially harmful blood clot. html:p Both types of warfarin resistance are related to how the body processes  warfarin. In some people with warfarin resistance, their blood clotting process  does not react effectively to the drug. Others with this resistance rapidly  break down (metabolize) warfarin, so the medication is quickly processed by  their bodies; these individuals are classified as"fast metabolizers"or"rapid  metabolizers"of warfarin. The severity of these abnormal processes determines  whether the warfarin resistance is complete or incomplete. html:p Warfarin resistance does not appear to cause any health problems other than  those associated with warfarin drug treatment.

Some  researchers believe they represent a single disorder with a range of signs and  symptoms. html:p Infants born with Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome are smaller than average  because the bones in their arms and legs are unusually short. The thigh and  upper arm bones are wider than usual at the ends (described as dumbbell-shaped),  and the bones of the spine (vertebrae) may also be abnormally shaped.  High-frequency hearing loss occurs in some cases. Distinctive facial features  include wide-set protruding eyes, a small and upturned nose with a flat bridge,  and a small lower jaw. Some affected infants are born with an opening in the  roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). html:p Most people with Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome experience significant  "catch-up"growth in the bones of the arms and legs during childhood.

Description1: html:p Winchester syndrome is a rare inherited disease characterized by a loss of bone  tissue (osteolysis), particularly in the hands and feet. Winchester syndrome  used to be considered part of a related condition now called multicentric  osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy (MONA). However, because Winchester  syndrome and MONA are caused by mutations in different genes, they are now  thought to be separate disorders. html:p In most cases of Winchester syndrome, bone loss begins in the hands and feet,  causing pain and limiting movement. Bone abnormalities later spread to other  parts of the body, with joint problems (arthropathy) occurring in the elbows,  shoulders, knees, hips, and spine. Most people with Winchester syndrome develop  low bone mineral density (osteopenia) and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis)  throughout the skeleton. These abnormalities make bones brittle and more prone  to fracture. The bone abnormalities also lead to . html:p Some people with Winchester syndrome have skin abnormalities including patches  of dark, thick, and leathery skin. Other features of the condition can include  clouding of the clear front covering of the eye (corneal opacity), excess hair  growth (hypertrichosis), overgrowth of the gums, heart abnormalities, and  distinctive facial features that are described as"coarse."

Description1: html:p Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is characterized by abnormal immune system function  (immune deficiency) and a reduced ability to form blood clots. This condition  primarily affects males. html:p Individuals with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have microthrombocytopenia, which is a  decrease in the number and size of blood cell fragments involved in clotting  (platelets). This platelet abnormality, which is typically present from birth,  can lead to easy bruising or episodes of prolonged bleeding following minor  trauma. html:p Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome causes many types of white blood cells, which are part  of the immune system, to be abnormal or nonfunctional, leading to an increased  risk of several immune and inflammatory disorders. Many people with this  condition develop eczema, an inflammatory skin disorder characterized by  abnormal patches of red, irritated skin. Affected individuals also have an  increased susceptibility to infection. People with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome are  at greater risk of developing autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune  system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormal</span>  electrical pathways in the heart that cause a disruption of the heart's normal  rhythm (arrhythmia). html:p The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in  a highly coordinated way. A specialized cluster of cells called the  atrioventricular node conducts electrical impulses from the heart's upper  chambers (the atria) to the lower chambers (the ventricles). Impulses move  through the atrioventricular node during each heartbeat, stimulating the  ventricles to contract slightly later than the atria. html:p People with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are born with an extra connection in  the heart, called an accessory pathway, that allows electrical signals to bypass  the atrioventricular node and move from the atria to the ventricles faster than  usual. The accessory pathway may also transmit electrical impulses abnormally  from the ventricles back to the atria. This extra connection can disrupt the  coordinated movement of electrical signals through the heart, leading to an  abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) and other changes in heart rhythm.  Resulting symptoms include dizziness, a sensation of fluttering or pounding in  the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, and fainting (syncope). In rare  cases, arrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can lead to  cardiac arrest and sudden death. The most common arrhythmia associated with  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is called paroxysmal supraventricular  tachycardia. html:p Complications of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can occur at any age, although  some individuals born with an accessory pathway in the heart never experience  any health problems associated with the condition. html:p Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome often occurs with other structural abnormalities  of the heart or underlying heart disease. The most common  associated with the condition is Ebstein anomaly, which affects the valve that  allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle (the tricuspid  valve). Additionally, the heart rhythm problems associated with  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be a component of several other genetic  syndromes, including hypokalemic periodic paralysis (a condition that causes  episodes of extreme muscle weakness), Pompe disease (a disorder characterized by  the storage of excess glycogen), Danon disease (a condition that weakens the  heart and skeletal muscles and causes  disability), and tuberous  sclerosis complex (a condition that results in the growth of noncancerous tumors  in many parts of the body).

frequency1: The estimated prevalence of Wolfram syndrome type 1 is 1 in 500,000 people worldwide. Approximately 200 cases have been described in the scientific literature. Only a few families from Jordan have been found to have Wolfram syndrome type 2.
Description1: html:p Wolfram syndrome is a condition that affects many of the body's systems. The  hallmark features of Wolfram syndrome are high blood sugar levels resulting from  a shortage of the hormone insulin (diabetes mellitus) and progressive vision  loss due to degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to  the brain (optic atrophy). People with Wolfram syndrome often also have  pituitary gland dysfunction that results in the excretion of excessive amounts  of urine (diabetes insipidus), hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear  (sensorineural deafness), urinary tract problems, reduced amounts of the sex  hormone testosterone in males (hypogonadism), or neurological or  disorders. html:p Diabetes mellitus is typically the first symptom of Wolfram syndrome, usually  diagnosed around age 6. Nearly everyone with Wolfram syndrome who develops  diabetes mellitus requires insulin replacement therapy. Optic atrophy is often  the next symptom to appear, usually around age 11. The first signs of optic  atrophy are loss of color vision and side (peripheral) vision. Over time, the  vision problems get worse, and people with optic atrophy are usually blind  within approximately 8 years after signs of optic atrophy first begin. html:p In diabetes insipidus, the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the  brain, does not function normally. This abnormality disrupts the release of a  hormone called vasopressin, which helps control the body's water balance and  urine production. Approximately 70 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome have  diabetes insipidus. Pituitary gland dysfunction can also cause hypogonadism in  males. The lack of testosterone that occurs with  . About 65 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome have  sensorineural deafness that can range in severity from deafness beginning at  birth to mild hearing loss beginning in adolescence that worsens over time.  Sixty to 90 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome have a urinary tract  problem. Urinary tract problems include obstruction of the ducts between the  kidneys and bladder (ureters), a large bladder that cannot empty normally  (high-capacity atonal bladder), disrupted urination (bladder sphincter  dyssynergia), and difficulty controlling the flow of urine (incontinence). html:p About 60 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome develop a neurological or  disorder, most commonly  , typically beginning in early adulthood. Other neurological problems  experienced by people with Wolfram syndrome include irregular breathing caused  by the brain's inability to control breathing (central apnea), loss of the sense  of smell, loss of the gag reflex, muscle spasms (myoclonus), , reduced  sensation in the lower extremities (peripheral neuropathy), and  impairment.  disorders associated with Wolfram syndrome include  psychosis, episodes of severe , and  and  behavior. html:p There are two types of Wolfram syndrome with many overlapping features. The two  types are differentiated by their genetic cause. In addition to the usual  features of Wolfram syndrome, individuals with Wolfram syndrome type 2 have  stomach or intestinal ulcers and excessive bleeding after an injury. The  tendency to bleed excessively combined with the ulcers typically leads to  abnormal bleeding in the gastrointestinal system. People with Wolfram syndrome  type 2 do not develop diabetes insipidus. html:p Wolfram syndrome is often fatal by mid-adulthood due to complications from the  many features of the condition, such as health problems related to diabetes  mellitus or neurological problems.

Females with Woodhouse-Sakati  syndrome do not have functional ovaries and may instead have undeveloped clumps  of tissue called streak gonads. The uterus may also be small or absent in  affected females. Males with this disorder have testes that produce little to no  sperm. As a result, people with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome usually have an  inability to conceive children (infertility). html:p By their mid-twenties, almost all affected individuals develop diabetes  mellitus, and they may also have reduced production of thyroid hormones  (hypothyroidism).

The true prevalence of this condition is unknown.</span>
Description1: html:p X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is a disorder that mainly affects males.  It involves many hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues in the body, particularly  a pair of small glands on top of each kidney called the adrenal glands. These  glands produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in  the body. html:p One of the main signs of this disorder is adrenal insufficiency, which occurs  when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. Adrenal insufficiency  typically begins in infancy or childhood and can cause vomiting, difficulty with  feeding, dehydration, extremely low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and shock. If  untreated, these complications are often life-threatening. html:p Affected males may also have a shortage of male sex hormones, which leads to  underdeveloped reproductive tissues, undescended testicles (cryptorchidism),  delayed puberty, and an inability to father children (infertility). Together,  these characteristics are known as . html:p The onset and severity of these signs and symptoms can vary, even among affected  members of the same family.

Description1: html:p X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic disorder that occurs primarily in  males. It mainly affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands, which are  small glands located on top of each kidney. In this disorder, the fatty covering  (myelin) that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord is prone to  deterioration (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to relay  information to the brain. In addition, damage to the outer layer of the adrenal  glands (adrenal cortex) causes a shortage of certain hormones (adrenocortical  insufficiency). Adrenocortical insufficiency may cause weakness, weight loss,  skin changes, vomiting, and coma. html:p There are three distinct types of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: a childhood  cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy type, and a form called Addison disease  only. html:p Children with the cerebral form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy experience  and  problems that usually begin between the ages of 4 and  10. Over time the symptoms worsen, and these children may have difficulty  reading, writing, understanding , and comprehending written material.  Additional signs and symptoms of the cerebral form include  behavior,  vision problems, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, and impaired adrenal  gland function. The rate at which this disorder progresses is variable but can  be extremely rapid, often leading to total disability within a few years. The  life expectancy of individuals with this type depends on the severity of the  signs and symptoms and how quickly the disorder progresses. Individuals with the  cerebral form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy usually survive only a few years  after symptoms begin but may survive longer with intensive medical support. html:p Signs and symptoms of the adrenomyeloneuropathy type appear between early  adulthood and middle age. Affected individuals develop progressive stiffness and  weakness in their legs (paraparesis), experience urinary and genital tract  disorders, and often show changes in behavior and thinking ability. Most people  with the adrenomyeloneuropathy type also have adrenocortical insufficiency. In  some severely affected individuals, damage to the brain and nervous system can  lead to early death. html:p People with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy whose only symptom is adrenocortical  insufficiency are said to have the Addison disease only form. In these  individuals, adrenocortical insufficiency can begin anytime between childhood  and adulthood. However, most affected individuals develop the additional  features of the adrenomyeloneuropathy type by the time they reach middle age.  The life expectancy of individuals with this form depends on the severity of the  signs and symptoms, but typically this is the mildest of the three types. html:p Rarely, individuals with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy develop multiple features  of the disorder in adolescence or early adulthood. In addition to  adrenocortical insufficiency, these individuals usually have  disorders and a loss of  function (dementia). It is unclear whether  these individuals have a distinct form of the condition or a variation of one of  the previously described types. html:p For reasons that are unclear, different forms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy  can be seen in affected individuals within the same family.

Description1: html:p X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a condition that affects the immune system  and occurs almost exclusively in males. People with XLA have very few B cells,  which are specialized white blood cells that help protect the body against  infection. B cells can mature into the cells that produce special proteins  called antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies attach to specific foreign  particles and germs, marking them for destruction. Individuals with XLA are more  susceptible to infections because their body makes very few antibodies. html:p Children with XLA are usually healthy for the first 1 or 2 months of life  because they are protected by antibodies acquired before birth from their  mother. After this time, the maternal antibodies are cleared from the body, and  the affected child begins to develop recurrent infections. In children with XLA,  infections generally take longer to get better and then they come back again,  even with antibiotic medications. The most common bacterial infections that  occur in people with XLA are lung infections (pneumonia and bronchitis), ear  infections (otitis), pink eye (conjunctivitis), and sinus infections  (sinusitis). Infections that cause chronic diarrhea are also common. Recurrent  infections can lead to organ damage. People with XLA can develop severe,  life-threatening bacterial infections; however, affected individuals are not  particularly vulnerable to infections caused by viruses. With treatment to  replace antibodies, infections can usually be prevented, improving the quality  of life for people with XLA.

Description1: <span style="background:#FFFF00;">html:p</span> <span style="background:#FFFF00;">X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia is a condition characterized by the abnormal</span>  . The normal heart has four  valves, two on the left side of the heart and two on the right side, that allow  blood to move through the heart and prevent blood from flowing backward. In  X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia, one or more of the four heart valves is  thickened and cannot open and close completely when the heart beats and pumps  blood. These malformed valves can cause abnormal blood flow and an irregular  heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur). html:p The signs and symptoms of X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia vary greatly among  affected individuals. Some people have no health problems, while in others  blood can leak through the thickened and partially closed valves. This valve  leakage (regurgitation) typically affects the mitral valve, which connects the  two left chambers of the heart, or the aortic valve, which regulates blood flow  from the heart into the large artery called the aorta. Valve regurgitation  forces the heart to pump harder to move blood through the heart. As a result,  affected individuals may develop chest pains, shortness of breath, or  lightheadedness. html:p In X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia, the mitral or aortic valve can also be  prolapsed, which means that the valve is weak or floppy. Valve prolapse further  prevents the thickened valve from closing properly and can lead to valve  regurgitation. Other rare complications of X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia  include inflammation of the inner lining of the heart (endocarditis), abnormal  blood clots, or sudden death. html:p X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia can be diagnosed anytime from birth (in some  cases prenatally) to late adulthood but is typically diagnosed in early to  mid-adulthood because valve malformation is often a slow process. This condition  affects males more often and more severely than females.

Description1: html:p X-linked hyper IgM syndrome is a condition that affects the immune system and  occurs almost exclusively in males. People with this disorder have abnormal  levels of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies help protect  the body against infection by attaching to specific foreign particles and  germs, marking them for destruction. There are several classes of antibodies,  and each one has a different function in the immune system. Although the name of  this condition implies that affected individuals always have high levels of  immunoglobulin M (IgM), some people have normal levels of this antibody. People  with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome have low levels of three other classes of  antibodies: immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E  (IgE). The lack of certain antibody classes makes it difficult for people with  this disorder to fight off infections. html:p Individuals with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome begin to develop frequent  infections in infancy and early childhood. Common infections include pneumonia,  sinus infections (sinusitis), and ear infections (otitis). Infections often  cause these children to have chronic diarrhea and they fail to gain weight and  grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Some people with X-linked hyper  IgM syndrome have low levels of white blood cells called neutrophils  (neutropenia). Affected individuals may develop autoimmune disorders, neurologic  complications from brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) infections,  liver disease, and gastrointestinal tumors. They also have an increased risk of  lymphoma, which is a cancer of immune system cells. html:p The severity of X-linked hyper IgM syndrome varies among affected individuals,  even among members of the same family. Without treatment, this condition can  result in death during childhood or adolescence.

Description1: html:p X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection,  and neoplasia (typically known by the acronym XMEN) is a disorder that affects  the immune system in males. In XMEN, certain types of immune system cells called  T cells are reduced in number or do not function properly. Normally these cells  recognize foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and are then  turned on (activated) to attack these invaders in order to prevent infection and  illness. Because males with XMEN do not have enough functional T cells, they  have frequent infections, such as ear infections, sinus infections, and  pneumonia. html:p In particular, affected individuals are vulnerable to the Epstein-Barr virus  (EBV). EBV is a very common virus that infects more than 90 percent of the  general population and in most cases goes unnoticed. Normally, after initial  infection, EBV remains in the body for the rest of a person's life. However, the  virus is generally inactive (latent) because it is controlled by T cells. In  males with XMEN, however, the T cells cannot control the virus, and EBV  infection can lead to cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas). The word  "neoplasia"in the condition name refers to these lymphomas; neoplasia is a  general term meaning abnormal growths of tissue. The EBV infection itself  usually does not cause any other symptoms in males with XMEN, and affected  individuals may not come to medical attention until they develop lymphoma.

This disorder</span>  affects the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the  back of the eye. Damage to the retina impairs the sharpness of vision (visual  acuity) in both eyes. Typically, X-linked juvenile retinoschisis affects cells  in the central area of the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible  for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading,  driving, and recognizing faces. X-linked juvenile retinoschisis is one type of a  broader disorder called macular degeneration, which disrupts the normal  functioning of the macula. Occasionally, side (peripheral) vision is affected in  people with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis. html:p X-linked juvenile retinoschisis is usually diagnosed when affected boys start  school and poor vision and difficulty with reading become apparent. In more  severe cases, eye squinting and involuntary movement of the eyes (nystagmus)  begin in infancy. Other early features of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis  include eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and  farsightedness (hyperopia). Visual acuity often declines in childhood and  adolescence but then stabilizes throughout adulthood until a significant decline  in visual acuity typically occurs in a man's fifties or sixties. Sometimes,  severe complications develop, such as separation of the retinal layers (retinal  detachment) or leakage of blood vessels in the retina (vitreous hemorrhage).  These eye abnormalities can further impair vision or cause blindness.

Description1: html:p X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a disorder of the immune system  and blood-forming cells that is found almost exclusively in males. More than  half of individuals with this disorder experience an exaggerated immune response  to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a very common virus that eventually  infects most humans. In some people it causes infectious mononucleosis (commonly  known as"mono"). Normally, after initial infection, EBV remains in certain  immune system cells (lymphocytes) called B cells. However, the virus is  generally inactive (latent) because it is controlled by other lymphocytes called  T cells that specifically target EBV-infected B cells. html:p People with XLP may respond to EBV infection by producing abnormally large  numbers of T cells, B cells, and other lymphocytes called macrophages. This  proliferation of immune cells often causes a life-threatening reaction called  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis causes  fever, destroys blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, and damages the liver.  The spleen, heart, kidneys, and other organs and tissues may also be affected.  In some individuals with XLP, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or related  symptoms may occur without EBV infection. html:p About one-third of people with XLP experience dysgammaglobulinemia, which means  they have abnormal levels of some types of antibodies. Antibodies (also known as  immunoglobulins) are proteins that attach to specific foreign particles and  germs, marking them for destruction. Individuals with dysgammaglobulinemia are  prone to recurrent infections. html:p Cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas) occur in about one-third of people  with XLP. html:p Without treatment, most people with XLP survive only into childhood. Death  usually results from hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. html:p XLP can be divided into two types based on its genetic cause and pattern of  signs and symptoms: XLP1 (also known as classic XLP) and XLP2. People with XLP2  have not been known to develop lymphoma, are more likely to develop  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis without EBV infection, usually have an  enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and may also have inflammation of the large  intestine (colitis). Some researchers believe that these individuals should  actually be considered to have a similar but separate disorder rather than a  type of XLP.

Description1: html:p X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda is a condition that impairs bone  and occurs almost exclusively in males. The name of the condition  indicates that it affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-) and the ends  (epiphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs."Tarda"indicates that signs  and symptoms of this condition are not present at birth, but appear later in  childhood, typically between ages 6 and 10. html:p Males with X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda have skeletal  abnormalities and . Affected boys grow steadily until late  childhood, when their . Male adult height ranges from 4 feet 10  inches to 5 feet 6 inches. Individuals with X-linked spondyloepiphyseal  dysplasia tarda have a short trunk and neck, and their arms appear  disproportionately long. Impaired growth of the spinal bones (vertebrae) causes  the  seen in this disorder. The spinal abnormalities include  flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly) with hump-shaped bulges, progressive  thinning of the discs between vertebrae, and an abnormal curvature of the spine  (scoliosis or kyphosis). Other skeletal features of X-linked spondyloepiphyseal  dysplasia tarda include an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper  leg bones to turn inward (coxa vara); a broad, barrel-shaped chest; and  decreased mobility of the elbow and hip joints. Arthritis often develops in  early adulthood, typically affecting the hip joints and spine.

frequency1: The estimated incidence of X-linked thrombocytopenia is between 1 and 10 per million males worldwide; this condition is rarer among females.
Description1: html:p X-linked thrombocytopenia is a bleeding disorder that primarily affects males.  This condition is characterized by a blood cell abnormality called  thrombocytopenia, which is a shortage in the number of blood cell fragments  involved in clotting (platelets). Affected individuals often have abnormally  small platelets as well, a condition called microthrombocytopenia. X-linked  thrombocytopenia can cause individuals to bruise easily or have episodes of  prolonged bleeding following minor trauma or even in the absence of injury  (spontaneous bleeding). Some people with this condition experience spontaneous  bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage), which can cause brain damage that  can be life-threatening. html:p Some people with X-linked thrombocytopenia also have patches of red, irritated  skin (eczema) or an increased susceptibility to infections. In severe cases,  additional features can develop, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders, which  occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and  organs. It is unclear, however, if people with these features have X-linked  thrombocytopenia or a more severe disorder with similar signs and symptoms  called Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. html:p Some people have a mild form of the disorder called intermittent  thrombocytopenia. These individuals have normal platelet production at times  with episodes of thrombocytopenia.

Name1: Xeroderma pigmentosum
GHR-webpage1: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/xeroderma-pigmentosum
frequency1: Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare disorder; it is estimated to affect about 1 in 1 million people in the United States and Europe. The condition is more common in Japan, North Africa, and the Middle East.
Description1: html:p Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is commonly known as XP, is an inherited condition  characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight.  This condition mostly affects the eyes and areas of skin exposed to the sun.  Some affected individuals also have problems involving the nervous system. html:p The signs of xeroderma pigmentosum usually appear in infancy or early childhood.  Many affected children develop a severe sunburn after spending just a few  minutes in the sun. The sunburn causes redness and blistering that can last for  weeks. Other affected children do not get sunburned with minimal sun exposure,  but instead tan normally. By age 2, almost all children with xeroderma  pigmentosum develop freckling of the skin in sun-exposed areas (such as the  face, arms, and lips); this type of freckling rarely occurs in young children  without the disorder. In affected individuals, exposure to sunlight often causes  dry skin (xeroderma) and changes in skin coloring (pigmentation). This  combination of features gives the condition its name, xeroderma pigmentosum. html:p People with xeroderma pigmentosum have a greatly increased risk of developing  skin cancer. Without sun protection, about half of children with this condition  develop their first skin cancer by age 10. Most people with xeroderma  pigmentosum develop multiple skin cancers during their lifetime. These cancers  occur most often on the face, lips, and eyelids. Cancer can also develop on the  scalp, in the eyes, and on the tip of the tongue. Studies suggest that people  with xeroderma pigmentosum may also have an increased risk of other types of  cancer, including brain tumors. Additionally, affected individuals who smoke  cigarettes have a significantly increased risk of lung cancer. html:p The eyes of people with xeroderma pigmentosum may be painfully sensitive to UV  rays from the sun. If the eyes are not protected from the sun, they may become  bloodshot and irritated, and the clear front covering of the eyes (the cornea)  may become cloudy. In some people, the eyelashes fall out and the eyelids may be  thin and turn abnormally inward or outward. In addition to an increased risk of  eye cancer, xeroderma pigmentosum is associated with noncancerous growths on  the eye. Many of these eye abnormalities can impair vision. html:p About 30 percent of people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop progressive  neurological abnormalities in addition to problems involving the skin and eyes.  These abnormalities can include hearing loss, poor coordination, difficulty  walking, movement problems, loss of  function, difficulty swallowing  and talking, and . When these neurological problems occur, they tend to  worsen with time. html:p Researchers have identified at least eight inherited forms of xeroderma  pigmentosum: complementation group A (XP-A) through complementation group G  (XP-G) plus a variant type (XP-V). The types are distinguished by their genetic  cause. All of the types increase skin cancer risk, although some are more likely  than others to be associated with neurological abnormalities.

Inheritance-pattern1: -related SCID is one of several forms of severe combined immunodeficiency, a  group of disorders with several genetic causes. Children with SCID lack  virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are  prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or  life-threatening. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with this  disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause  illness in healthy people. Infants with SCID typically experience pneumonia,  chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. They also grow much more slowly  than healthy children. If not treated in a way that restores immune function,  children with SCID usually live only a year or two.

Description1: html:p Zellweger spectrum disorder is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs  and symptoms and affect many parts of the body. This group of conditions  includes Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile  Refsum disease. These conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders but  are now considered to be part of the same condition spectrum. Zellweger  syndrome is the most severe form of the Zellweger spectrum disorder, NALD is  intermediate in severity, and infantile Refsum disease is the least severe form.  Because these three conditions are now considered one disorder, some  researchers prefer not to use the separate condition names but to instead refer  to cases as severe, intermediate, or mild. html:p Individuals with Zellweger syndrome, at the severe end of the spectrum, develop  signs and symptoms of the condition during the newborn period. These infants  experience  (), feeding problems, hearing and vision  loss, and . These problems are caused by the breakdown of myelin, which  is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of  nerve impulses. The part of the brain and spinal cord that contains myelin is  called white matter. Destruction of myelin (demyelination) leads to loss of  white matter (leukodystrophy). Children with Zellweger syndrome also develop  life-threatening problems in other organs and tissues, such as the liver, heart,  and kidneys. They may have skeletal abnormalities, including a large space  between the bones of the skull (fontanelles) and characteristic bone spots known  as chondrodysplasia punctata that can be seen on x-ray. Affected individuals  have distinctive facial features, including a flattened face, broad nasal  bridge, and high forehead. Children with Zellweger syndrome typically do not  survive beyond the first year of life. html:p People with NALD or infantile Refsum disease, which are at the less-severe end  of the spectrum, have more variable features than those with Zellweger syndrome  and usually do not develop signs and symptoms of the disease until late infancy  or early childhood. They may have many of the features of Zellweger syndrome;  however, their condition typically progresses more slowly. Children with these  less-severe conditions often have , vision problems, hearing loss,  liver dysfunction,  . Most people with NALD survive into childhood, and those with  infantile Refsum disease may reach adulthood. In rare cases, individuals at the  mildest end of the condition spectrum have  in childhood and  hearing loss or vision problems beginning in adulthood and do not develop the  other features of this disorder.
