The Test also includes analysis of tumour mutational burden (TMB) which specifically predicts response to immunotherapy. Actionable genetic variants detected by Oncofocus® are currently linked to 717 anti-cancer targeted therapies/therapy combinations. Targeted actionable hotspots include SNVs, indels, CNVs and gene fusions. Notably these driver cancer genes have been selected because they are the most clinically relevant and have been approved for reimbursement in the US."
