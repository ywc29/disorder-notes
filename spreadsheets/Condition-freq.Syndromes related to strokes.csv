"Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adenosine-deaminase-2-deficiency,Stroke,"A disorder characterized by abnormal inflammation of various tissues, particularly the blood vessels (vasculitis). Depending on the severity and location of the inflammation, the disorder can cause disability or be life-threatening. Features that have been described in people with ADA2 deficiency include recurrent strokes affecting structures deep in the brain that can start in the first few years of life. ","Mutations in the ADA2 gene severely reduce or eliminate the function of adenosine deaminase 2. Researchers do not fully understand how a loss of this enzyme's function leads to the features of ADA2 deficiency."
"Aldosterone-producing adenoma",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/aldosterone-producing-adenoma,"Heart attack, stroke","They have an increased risk of heart attack, stroke","Caused by mutations in one of several genes (ATP1A1, ATP2B, CACNA1D, CTNNB1, KCNJ5). The most commonly mutated gene is KCNJ5, accounting for an estimated 40 percent of the tumors, followed by the CACNA1D and ATP1A1 genes, which are mutated in about 9 percent and 6 percent of aldosterone-producing adenomas, respectively. "
"ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alg6-congenital-disorder-of-glycosylation,Stroke,"People with ALG6-CDG may have stroke-like episodes ","ALG6 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal enzyme with reduced or no activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally, and oligosaccharides are incomplete. As a result, glycosylation is reduced or absent. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG6-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and fats that are needed for normal function in many organs and tissues, including the brain, eyes, liver, and hormone-producing (endocrine) system."
"Antiphospholipid syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/antiphospholipid-syndrome,Stroke,"A disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. If a blood clot forms in the vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke. ","The genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. This condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins (antibodies) in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I."
"Arterial tortuosity syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/arterial-tortuosity-syndrome,"Heart attack, stroke","Blockage of blood flow to vital organs such as the heart, or brain can lead to heart attacks and strokes","SLC2A10 gene mutations that cause arterial tortuosity syndrome reduce or eliminate GLUT10 function. By mechanisms that are not well understood, a lack (deficiency) of functional GLUT10 protein leads to overactivity (upregulation) of TGF-β signaling. Excessive growth signaling results in elongation of the arteries, leading to tortuosity. "
"Autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autosomal-recessive-hyper-ige-syndrome,Stroke,"Blockage of blood flow in the brain or abnormal bleeding in the brain, both of which can lead to stroke, can also occur in AR-HIES.","DOCK8 gene mutations result in the production of little or no functional DOCK8 protein. Shortage of this protein impairs normal immune cell development and function. "
"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cerebral-autosomal-dominant-arteriopathy-with-subcortical-infarcts-and-leukoencephalopathy,Stroke,"An inherited condition that causes stroke and other impairments.","Damaged blood vessels reduce blood flow and can cause areas of tissue death (infarcts) throughout the body. An infarct in the brain can lead to a stroke. In individuals with CADASIL, a stroke can occur at any time from childhood to late adulthood, but typically happens during mid-adulthood. People with CADASIL often have more than one stroke in their lifetime. "
"Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cerebral-autosomal-recessive-arteriopathy-with-subcortical-infarcts-and-leukoencephalopathy,Stroke,"An inherited condition that causes stroke and other impairments. About half of affected individuals have a stroke or similar episode before age 40.","Mutations in the HTRA1 gene prevent the effective regulation of TGF-β signaling."
"Clopidogrel resistance",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/clopidogrel-resistance,"Heart attack, stroke","Clopidogrel resistance is a condition in which the drug clopidogrel is less effective than normal in people who are treated with it. People with clopidogrel resistance who receive clopidogrel are at risk of serious, sometimes fatal, complications. These individuals may have another heart attack or stroke caused by abnormal blood clot formation","The two most common CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms associated with clopidogrel resistance (known as CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3) result in the production of a nonfunctional CYP2C19 enzyme that cannot convert clopidogrel to its active form. Without active clopidogrel to interfere, the P2RY12 receptor continues to promote platelet aggregation and blood clot formation, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and thromboses in individuals with a history of these conditions."
"COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/col4a1-related-brain-small-vessel-disease,Stroke,"Characterized by weakening of the blood vessels in the brain. Stroke is often the first symptom of this condition, typically occurring in mid-adulthood.In affected individuals, stroke is usually caused by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) rather than a lack of blood flow in the brain (ischemic stroke), although either type can occur. Individuals with this condition are at increased risk of having more than one stroke in their lifetime. ","The COL4A1 gene mutations that cause COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease result in the production of a protein that disrupts the structure of type IV collagen. As a result, type IV collagen molecules cannot attach to each other to form the protein networks in basement membranes. Basement membranes without these networks are unstable, leading to weakening of the tissues that they surround. In people with COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease, the vasculature in the brain weakens, which can lead to blood vessel breakage and stroke."
"Critical congenital heart disease",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/critical-congenital-heart-disease,Stroke,"Some people with treated CCHD have few related health problems later in life. However, long-term effects of CCHD can include delayed development and reduced stamina during exercise. Adults with these heart defects have an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and premature death.","Studies suggest that these genes (CFC1, FOXH1, GATA4, GATA6, GDF1, GJA1, HAND1, MED13L, NKX2-5, NKX2-6, NOTCH1, SMAD6, ZFPM2. Changes in single genes have been associated with CCHD) are involved in normal heart development before birth. Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart. Studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in CCHD. However, it is unclear whether genes affected by copy number variation are involved in heart development and how having missing or extra copies of those genes could lead to heart defects. Researchers believe that single-gene mutations and copy number variation account for a relatively small percentage of all CCHD."
"Essential thrombocythemia",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/essential-thrombocythemia,Stroke,"Abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis) is common in people with essential thrombocythemia and causes many signs and symptoms of this condition. Clots that block blood flow to the brain can cause strokes or temporary stroke-like episodes known as transient ischemic attacks. ","The JAK2 and CALR genes are the most commonly mutated genes in essential thrombocythemia. The MPL, THPO, and TET2 genes can also be altered in this condition. "
"Fabry disease",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/fabry-disease,"Heart attack, stroke","An inherited disorder that results from the buildup of a particular type of fat, called globotriaosylceramide, in the body's cells. Fabry disease also involves potentially life-threatening complications such as progressive kidney damage, heart attack, and stroke. ","GLA gene mutations that result in an absence of alpha-galactosidase A activity lead to the classic, severe form of Fabry disease. Mutations that decrease but do not eliminate the enzyme's activity usually cause the milder, late-onset forms of Fabry disease that affect only the heart or kidneys."
"Familial atrial fibrillation",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-atrial-fibrillation,Stroke,"An inherited abnormality of the heart's normal rhythm. Atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of stroke and sudden death.","Familial atrial fibrillation often results from rare mutations in single genes. However, these cases represent only a small fraction of all individuals with atrial fibrillation. (ABCC9, GJA5, KCNA5, KCNE2, KCNH2, KCNJ2, KCNQ1, LMNA, MYL4, NKX2-5, NPPA, NUP155, PRKAG2, RYR2, SCN1B, SCN2B, SCN3B, SCN4B, SCN5A)"
"Familial erythrocytosis",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-erythrocytosis,"Heart attack, stroke","An inherited condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells (erythrocytes). The excess red blood cells also increase the risk of developing abnormal blood clots that can block the flow of blood through arteries and veins. If these clots restrict blood flow to essential organs and tissues (particularly the heart, lungs, or brain), they can cause life-threatening complications such as a heart attack or stroke. ","Mutations in the EPOR, VHL, EGLN1, or EPAS1 gene. "
"Familial hyperaldosteronism",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-hyperaldosteronism,"Heart attack, stroke","People with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood pressure (hypertension), often early in life. Without treatment, hypertension increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure.","Familial hyperaldosteronism type I is caused by the abnormal joining together (fusion) of two similar genes called CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, which are located close together on chromosome 8. Familial hyperaldosteronism type III is caused by mutations in the KCNJ5 gene. Mutations in the KCNJ5 gene likely result in the production of potassium channels that are less selective, allowing other ions (predominantly sodium) to pass as well. The abnormal ion flow results in the activation of biochemical processes (pathways) that lead to increased aldosterone production, causing the hypertension associated with familial hyperaldosteronism type III. The genetic cause of familial hyperaldosteronism type II is unknown."
"Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-and-dissection,"Heart attack, stroke","Involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Depending on the genetic cause of familial TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.","Mutations in any of several genes (ACTA2, FBN1, MYH11, MYLK, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFBR1, TGFBRa) re associated with familial TAAD. Mutations in the ACTA2 gene have been identified in 14 to 20 percent of people with this disorder, and TGFBR2 gene mutations have been found in 2.5 percent of affected individuals. Mutations in several other genes account for smaller percentages of cases."
"Generalized arterial calcification of infancy",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/generalized-arterial-calcification-of-infancy,"Heart attack, stroke","As a result of the cardiovascular problems associated with GACI, individuals with this condition often do not survive past infancy, with death typically caused by a heart attack or stroke. ","Mutations in the ENPP1 gene are thought to result in reduced availability of pyrophosphate, leading to excessive calcification in the body and causing the signs and symptoms of GACI. Mutations in the ABCC6 gene lead to an absent or nonfunctional MRP6 protein. It is unclear how a lack of properly functioning MRP6 protein leads to GACI."
"Grange syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/grange-syndrome,"Stroke heart attack?","Characterized by narrowing (stenosis) or blockage (occlusion) of arteries that supply blood to various organs and tissues, including the brain, and heart. Blockage of the arteries that carry blood to the brain (cerebral arteries) can cause a stroke.","Mutations in the YY1AP1 gene likely disrupt the function of the complex, which leads to reduced proliferation and differentiation of smooth muscle cells. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to narrowing and blockage of arteries."
"Hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-angiopathy-with-nephropathy-aneurysms-and-muscle-cramps-syndrome,Stroke,"Compared to other COL4A1-related disorders, the brain is only mildly affected in HANAC syndrome. People with this condition may have a bulge in one or multiple blood vessels in the brain (intracranial aneurysms). These aneurysms have the potential to burst, causing bleeding within the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). ","The COL4A1 gene mutations that cause HANAC syndrome result in the production of a protein that disrupts the structure of type IV collagen. As a result, type IV collagen molecules cannot attach to each other to form the protein networks in basement membranes. Basement membranes without these networks are unstable, leading to weakening of the tissues that they surround. In people with HANAC syndrome, the vasculature and other tissues within the kidneys, brain, muscles, eyes, and throughout the body weaken."
"Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy,Stroke,"A condition that can cause a progressive loss of intellectual function (dementia), stroke. The Dutch type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common form. Stroke is frequently the first sign of the Dutch type and is fatal in about one third of people who have this condition. Survivors often develop dementia and have recurrent strokes. About half of individuals with the Dutch type who have one or more strokes will have recurrent seizures (epilepsy).People with the Flemish and Italian types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy are prone to recurrent strokes and dementia. The first sign of the Icelandic type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is typically a stroke followed by dementia. Strokes associated with the Icelandic type usually occur earlier than the other types, with individuals typically experiencing their first stroke in their twenties or thirties.","Mutations in the APP gene are the most common cause of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. APP gene mutations cause the Dutch, Italian, Arctic, Iowa, Flemish, and Piedmont types of this condition. Mutations in the CST3 gene cause the Icelandic type. Familial British and Danish dementia are caused by mutations in the ITM2B gene."
"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome,"Heart attack, stroke","People with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome experience severe hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) beginning in childhood. This condition greatly increases the chances of having a heart attack or stroke at a young age. These serious complications can worsen over time and are life-threatening for affected individuals.","Mutations in the LMNA gene cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Mutations that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal version of the lamin A protein. The altered protein makes the nuclear envelope unstable and progressively damages the nucleus, making cells more likely to die prematurely. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the characteristic features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome."
"Liddle syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/liddle-syndrome,"Heart attack, stroke","Some people with Liddle syndrome have no additional signs or symptoms, especially in childhood. Over time, however, untreated hypertension can lead to heart disease or stroke, which may be fatal.","Mutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene change the structure of the respective ENaC subunit. The changes alter a region of the subunit that is involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation) when it is no longer needed. As a result of the mutations, the subunit proteins are not degraded, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium (followed by water), which leads to hypertension. Reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia."
"Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lysosomal-acid-lipase-deficiency,"Heart attack, stroke","Some people with this later-onset form of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency develop an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis). Although these deposits are common in the general population, they usually begin at an earlier age in people with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. The deposits narrow the arteries, increasing the chance of heart attack or stroke. ","Mutations in the LIPA gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional lysosomal acid lipase."
"Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/microcephalic-osteodysplastic-primordial-dwarfism-type-ii,Stroke,"Some affected individuals have Moyamoya disease, in which arteries at the base of the brain are narrowed, leading to restricted blood flow. These vascular abnormalities are often treatable, though they increase the risk of stroke and reduce the life expectancy of affected individuals.","PCNT gene mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional pericentrin protein that cannot anchor other proteins to the centrosome. As a result, centrosomes cannot properly assemble microtubules, leading to disruption of the cell cycle and cell division. Impaired cell division causes a reduction in cell production, while disruption of the cell cycle can lead to cell death. This overall reduction in the number of cells leads to short bones, microcephaly, and the other signs and symptoms of MOPDII."
"Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mitochondrial-encephalomyopathy-lactic-acidosis-and-stroke-like-episodes,"Stroke-like episodes","Most affected individuals experience stroke-like episodes beginning before age 40. These episodes often involve temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), altered consciousness, vision abnormalities, seizures, and severe headaches resembling migraines. Repeated stroke-like episodes can progressively damage the brain, ","MELAS can result from mutations in one of several genes, including MT-ND1, MT-ND5, MT-TH, MT-TL1, and MT-TV. These genes are found in the DNA of cellular structures called mitochondria, Mutations in a particular transfer RNA gene, MT-TL1, cause more than 80 percent of all cases of MELAS. These mutations impair the ability of mitochondria to make proteins, use oxygen, and produce energy. Researchers have not determined how changes in mtDNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of MELAS. "
"Moyamoya disease",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/moyamoya-disease,"Stroke-like episodes, Stroke","A disorder of blood vessels in the brain, specifically the internal carotid arteries and the arteries that branch from them. These vessels, which provide oxygen-rich blood to the brain, narrow over time. Narrowing of these vessels reduces blood flow in the brain. In an attempt to compensate, new networks of small, fragile blood vessels form. These networks, visualized by a particular test called an angiogram, resemble puffs of smoke, which is how the condition got its name: ""moyamoya"" is an expression meaning ""something hazy like a puff of smoke"" in Japanese. A lack of blood supply to the brain leads to several symptoms of the disorder, including temporary stroke-like episodes (transient ischemic attacks), strokes","Changes in the RNF213 gene involved in moyamoya disease replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RNF213 protein. The effect of these changes on the function of the RNF213 protein is unknown,"
"Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/phosphoglycerate-kinase-deficiency,Stroke,"A genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary energy source for most cells.Some people with the hemolytic form also have symptoms related to abnormal brain function, including intellectual disability, seizures, and stroke.","Mutations in the PGK1 gene reduce the activity of phosphoglycerate kinase, which disrupts energy production and leads to cell damage or cell death. It is unclear why this abnormality preferentially affects red blood cells and brain cells in some people and muscle cells in others."
"Polycythemia vera",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycythemia-vera,"Heart attack, stroke","Characterized by an increased number of red blood cells in the bloodstream. Affected individuals may also have excess white blood cells and blood clotting cell fragments called platelets. These extra cells and platelets cause the blood to be thicker than normal. As a result, abnormal blood clots are more likely to form and block the flow of blood through arteries and veins. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of heart attack and stroke caused by blood clots in the heart and brain.","Mutations in the JAK2 and TET2 genes are associated with polycythemia vera. JAK2 gene mutations result in the production of a JAK2 protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), which increases production of blood cells and prolongs their survival. With so many extra cells in the bloodstream, abnormal blood clots are more likely to form. Thicker blood also flows more slowly throughout the body, which prevents organs from receiving enough oxygen. Many of the signs and symptoms of polycythemia vera are related to a shortage of oxygen in body tissues. The function of the TET2 gene is unknown. Although mutations in the TET2 gene have been found in approximately 16 percent of people with polycythemia vera, it is unclear what role these mutations play in the development of the condition."
Preeclampsia,,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/preeclampsia,"Heart attack, stroke","Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy in which affected women develop high blood pressure (hypertension); they can also have abnormally high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). This condition usually occurs in the last few months of pregnancy and often requires early delivery of the infant.In severe cases, however, preeclampsia can damage the mother's organs, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, and can lead to life-threatening complications. Extremely high blood pressure in the mother can cause bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Women who have had preeclampsia have approximately twice the lifetime risk of heart disease and stroke than do women in the general population. ","The specific causes of preeclampsia are not well understood. "
"Prekallikrein deficiency",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/prekallikrein-deficiency,"Heart attack, stroke","A few people with prekallikrein deficiency have experienced health problems related to blood clotting such as heart attack, stroke, ","The KLKB1 gene mutations that cause prekallikrein deficiency reduce or eliminate functional plasma kallikrein, which likely impairs the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Researchers suggest that this lack (deficiency) of functional plasma kallikrein protein does not generally cause any symptoms because another process called the extrinsic coagulation pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) can compensate for the impaired intrinsic coagulation pathway."
"Sick sinus syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sick-sinus-syndrome,"Heart failure, stroke","Symptoms related to abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope). Sick sinus syndrome occurs most commonly in older adults, although it can be diagnosed in people of any age. The condition increases the risk of several life-threatening problems involving the heart and blood vessels. These include a heart rhythm abnormality called heart failure, cardiac arrest, and stroke.","Genetic changes are an uncommon cause of sick sinus syndrome. Mutations in two genes, SCN5A and HCN4, have been found to cause the condition in a small number of families. A particular variation in another gene, MYH6, appears to increase the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome."
Sitosterolemia,,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sitosterolemia,"Heart attack, stroke","In people with sitosterolemia, accumulation of fatty deposits in arteries (atherosclerosis) can occur as early as childhood. These deposits narrow the arteries and can eventually block blood flow, increasing the chance of a heart attack, stroke, or sudden death.","Sitosterolemia is caused by mutations in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 gene. "
"Sturge-Weber syndrome",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sturge-weber-syndrome,"Stroke-like episodes, Stroke","The decrease in blood flow caused by leptomeningeal angiomas can cause stroke-like episodes in people with Sturge-Weber syndrome. These episodes often involve temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), vision abnormalities, seizures, and migraine headaches. In affected individuals, these episodes usually begin by age 2.","The GNAQ gene mutation that causes Sturge-Weber syndrome results in the production of a protein with impaired function. As a result, the altered Gαq protein cannot play its part in regulating signaling pathways, resulting in abnormally increased signaling. The enhanced signaling likely disrupts the regulation of blood vessel development, causing abnormal and excessive formation of vessels before birth in people with Sturge-Weber syndrome."
"Systemic lupus erythematosus",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/systemic-lupus-erythematosus,Stroke,"Heart disease caused by fatty buildup in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis), which is very common in the general population, is even more common in people with SLE. The inflammation characteristic of SLE can also damage the nervous system, and may result in abnormal sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy); seizures; stroke","Normal variations (polymorphisms) in many genes (BANK1, C4A, C4B, C4B_2, CR2, CRP, CTLA4, DNASE1, DNASE1L3, FCGR2B, IRF5, ITGAM, LTK, NCF2, PDCD1, PTPN22, RASGRP1, RIPK1, STAT4, TLR5, TNFAIP3, TNFSF4, TREX) can affect the risk of developing SLE, and in most cases multiple genetic factors are thought to be involved. In rare cases, SLE is caused by mutations in single genes. Most of the genes associated with SLE are involved in immune system function, and variations in these genes likely affect proper targeting and control of the immune response. Sex hormones and a variety of environmental factors including viral infections, diet, stress, chemical exposures, and sunlight are also thought to play a role in triggering this complex disorder. "
"Transthyretin amyloidosis",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/transthyretin-amyloidosis,Stroke,"A slowly progressive condition characterized by the buildup of abnormal deposits of a protein called amyloid (amyloidosis) in the body's organs and tissues.

"Type 1 diabetes",,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/type-1-diabetes,"Heart attack, stroke","A disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels. In this form of diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas called beta cells stop producing insulin. People with type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and problems with urinary and sexual function.","Type 1 diabetes is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. For unknown reasons, in people with type 1 diabetes the immune system damages the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Damage to these cells impairs insulin production and leads to the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes.The risk of developing type 1 diabetes is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.
