text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>FMR1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called FMRP. This protein is present in many tissues, including the brain, testes, and ovaries. In the brain, it may play a role in the development of connections between nerve cells  (synapses), where cell-to-cell communication occurs. The synapses can change and adapt over time in response to experience (a characteristic called synaptic plasticity). FMRP may help regulate synaptic plasticity, which is important for learning and memory. The protein's role in the testes and ovaries is not well understood.
text/html/html:p(2): Researchers believe that FMRP acts as a shuttle within cells by transporting molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as the genetic blueprint for making proteins. FMRP likely carries mRNA molecules from the nucleus to areas of the cell where proteins are assembled. FMRP also helps control when the instructions in these mRNA molecules are used to build proteins, some of which may be important for functioning of the nerves, testes, or ovaries.
text/html/html:p(3): One region of the <i>FMR1</i> gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CGG trinucleotide repeat, so called because this segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times within the gene. In most people, the number of CGG repeats ranges from fewer than 10 to about 40. This CGG repeat segment is typically interrupted several times by a different three-base sequence, AGG. Having AGG scattered among the CGG triplets appears to help stabilize the long repeated segment.
