text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>LMNB1</i> gene provides instructions for making the lamin B1 protein. Lamin B1 is a structural protein called an intermediate filament protein. Intermediate filaments provide stability and strength to cells. Lamin B1 is a scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear envelope, which is the structure that surrounds the nucleus in cells. Specifically, this protein is located in the nuclear lamina, a mesh-like layer of intermediate filaments and other proteins that is attached to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. As part of the nuclear envelope, lamin B1 helps regulate the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. The protein also plays a role in the copying (replication) of DNA in preparation for cell division and the activity (expression) of many genes by being involved in the organization of chromosomes within the nucleus.</p>
