text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>CTDP1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1. This protein helps regulate the activity of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. The RNA polymerase II enzyme initiates transcription, which is a key step in using the information carried by genes to direct the production (synthesis) of proteins.
