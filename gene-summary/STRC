text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>STRC</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called stereocilin. This protein is found in the inner ear and appears to be involved in hearing.
text/html/html:p(2): Stereocilin is associated with hairlike structures called stereocilia, which project from specialized cells called hair cells in the inner ear. Specifically, stereocilin helps to maintain the structure of stereocilia by linking their tips to one another. Stereocilia bend in response to sound waves, triggering a series of reactions within hair cells that generate a nerve impulse. Such nerve impulses are transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.
