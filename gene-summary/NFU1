text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>NFU1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the formation of molecules called iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. These clusters are attached to certain other proteins and are required for their proper function.
text/html/html:p(2): Two versions (isoforms) of the NFU-1 protein are produced from the <i>NFU1</i> gene. One version is found in cellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy-producing centers of cells. In these structures, several proteins carry out a series of chemical steps to convert the energy in food into a form that cells can use. Many of the proteins involved in this process require Fe-S clusters to function, including protein complexes called complex I, complex II, and complex III.
text/html/html:p(3): Fe-S clusters are also required for another mitochondrial protein to function; this protein is involved in the modification of additional proteins that aid in energy production in mitochondria, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This modification is also critical to the function of the glycine cleavage system, a set of proteins that breaks down a protein building block (amino acid) called glycine when levels become too high.
text/html/html:p(4): The other version of the NFU-1 protein is found in the fluid-filled space inside the cell (the cytoplasm). While this protein is likely involved in Fe-S cluster formation in the cytoplasm, the role of this isoform is not well understood.
