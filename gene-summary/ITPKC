text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ITPKC</i> gene provides instructions for making one version (isoform) of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (ITPK) enzyme. This enzyme helps add a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to a molecule called Ins(1,4,5)P3 to produce a molecule called Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Both of these molecules are involved in regulating the amount of calcium in cells.</p><p>Several versions (isoforms) of the ITPK enzyme are produced from different genes. They play a variety of roles in processes throughout the body. The isoform produced from the <i>ITPKC</i> gene is called inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC). It is involved in a mechanism called the Ca(2+)/NFAT signaling pathway, which is affected by calcium levels. This pathway helps limit the activity of immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. Reducing the activity of T cells when appropriate prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and which, in excess, cause tissue damage.</p>
