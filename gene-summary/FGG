text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>FGG</i> gene provides instructions for making the fibrinogen gamma (γ) chain, one piece (subunit) of the fibrinogen protein. This protein is important for blood clot formation (coagulation), which is needed to stop excessive bleeding after injury. To form fibrinogen, the γ chain attaches to the fibrinogen A alpha (Aα) and fibrinogen B beta (Bβ) chains, each produced from different genes. Two sets of this three-protein complex combine to form functional fibrinogen.
text/html/html:p(2): For coagulation to occur, another protein called thrombin removes a piece from the Aα and the Bβ subunits of the functional fibrinogen protein (the pieces are called the A and B fibrinopeptides). This process converts fibrinogen to fibrin, the main protein in blood clots. Fibrin proteins attach to each other, forming a stable network that makes up the blood clot.
