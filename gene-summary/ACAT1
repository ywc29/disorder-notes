text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ACAT1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in the energy-producing centers within cells (mitochondria). This enzyme plays an essential role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet. Specifically, it helps process isoleucine, an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins. This enzyme is also involved in processing ketones, which are molecules that are produced when fats are broken down in the body.</p><p>During the breakdown of proteins, the ACAT1 enzyme is responsible for the last step in processing isoleucine.  It converts a molecule called 2-methyl-acetoacetyl-CoA into two smaller molecules, propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, that can be used to produce energy.</p><p>The ACAT1 enzyme carries out the last step in ketone breakdown (ketolysis) during the processing of fats.  The enzyme converts a molecule called acetoacetyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-CoA, which can be used to produce energy.  In the liver, the enzyme also carries out this chemical reaction in reverse, which is the first step in building new ketones (ketogenesis).</p>
