text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>ACP5</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (TRAP). The TRAP enzyme primarily regulates the activity of a protein called osteopontin, which is produced in bone cells called osteoclasts and in immune cells. Osteopontin performs a variety of functions in these cells. Two versions (isoforms) of the TRAP enzyme are produced: TRAP5a is found primarily in immune cells and TRAP5b is found primarily in bone cells called osteoclasts.
text/html/html:p(2): Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down and remove (resorb) bone tissue that is no longer needed. These cells are involved in bone remodeling, which is a normal process that replaces old bone tissue with new bone. During bone remodeling, osteopontin is turned on (activated), allowing osteoclasts to attach (bind) to bones. When the breakdown of bone is complete, TRAP5b turns off (inactivates) osteopontin, causing the osteoclasts to release themselves from bone.
text/html/html:p(3): In the immune system, osteopontin is found primarily in cells called macrophages and dendritic cells. The protein helps fight infection by promoting inflammation, regulating immune cell activity, and turning on various immune system cells that are necessary to fight off foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Like TRAP5b in bone cells, the TRAP5a enzyme inactivates osteopontin in macrophages and dendritic cells when it is no longer needed.
