text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>GALK1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called galactokinase 1.  This enzyme enables the body to process a simple sugar called galactose, which is present in small amounts in many foods. Galactose is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas.</p><p>Galactokinase 1 is responsible for one step in a chemical process that converts galactose into other molecules that can be used by the body.  Specifically, this enzyme modifies galactose to create a similar molecule called galactose-1-phosphate.  A series of additional steps converts galactose-1-phosphate to another simple sugar called glucose, which is the main energy source for most cells.  Galactose-1-phosphate can also be converted to a form that is used to build galactose-containing proteins and fats.  These modified proteins and fats play critical roles in chemical signaling, building cellular structures, transporting molecules, and producing energy.</p>
