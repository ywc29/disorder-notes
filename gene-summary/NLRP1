text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>NLRP1</i> gene provides instructions for making a member of a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins. These proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. The body then stops (inhibits) the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.
text/html/html:p(2): The NLRP1 protein is involved in the assembly of a molecular complex called an inflammasome, which helps trigger the inflammatory process in response to the presence of bacteria or viruses. Researchers believe that the NLRP1 protein may also play a role in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).
