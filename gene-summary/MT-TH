text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MT-TH</i> gene provides instructions for making a particular type of RNA, a molecule that is a chemical cousin of DNA. This type of RNA, called transfer RNA (tRNA), helps assemble protein building blocks known as amino acids into full-length, functioning proteins. The <i>MT-TH</i> gene provides instructions for a specific form of tRNA that is designated as tRNA<sup>His</sup>. During protein assembly, this molecule attaches to a particular amino acid, histidine (His), and inserts it into the appropriate locations in the growing protein.</p><p>The tRNA<sup>His</sup> molecule is present in cellular structures called mitochondria. These structures convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. Through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria use oxygen, simple sugars, and fatty acids to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. The tRNA<sup>His</sup> molecule is involved in the assembly of proteins that carry out oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
