text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>HSD17B10</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called HSD10. This protein is located within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers inside cells, where it has several different functions.</p><p>The HSD10 protein is important for the production (synthesis) of proteins in mitochondria. (While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus, called the cytoplasm, a few proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.) During protein synthesis, whether in the cytoplasm or in mitochondria, molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs) help assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into the chains that form proteins. The HSD10 protein is involved in making functional mitochondrial tRNA. It forms a complex with an enzyme called TRMT10C to modify tRNAs so that they are more stable and can function properly. In addition, the complex interacts with another enzyme called PRORP to perform an enzymatic function called mitochondrial RNase P (mtRNase P) that cuts precursor RNA molecules, which is an essential step to generating tRNA molecules. Normal mitochondrial protein production, which requires tRNAs, is essential for the formation of the protein complexes that convert the energy from food into a form cells can use.</p><p>The HSD10 protein also plays an important role in processing several substances in the body. It helps break down the amino acid isoleucine. Specifically, it is responsible for the fifth step in this process, in which 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is converted into 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA. Through a similar mechanism, the HSD10 protein also processes a group of fats called branched-chain fatty acids.</p><p>The HSD10 protein is also thought to be involved in chemical reactions involving female sex hormones (estrogens) and male sex hormones (androgens). HSD10 turns off (inactivates) a potent form of estrogen called 17β-estradiol by converting it to a weaker form called estrone. HSD10 also generates a potent androgen called dihydrotestosterone from a weak androgen called 3α-androstanediol. These reactions are critical for maintaining appropriate levels of male and female sex hormones.</p><p>The HSD10 protein also plays a role in certain chemical reactions involving neurosteroids, which are substances that regulate the activity of the nervous system. This protein inactivates two neurosteroids called allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone. These neurosteroids interact with receptors that prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. By regulating the activity of these neurosteroids, the HSD10 protein may help maintain normal brain function. However, other proteins in the body can also carry out these reactions, and the importance of HSD10 in these functions is unclear.</p>
