text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>GLDC</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glycine dehydrogenase. This enzyme is one of four components (subunits) that make up a large complex called glycine cleavage enzyme.  Within cells, this complex is active in specialized energy-producing centers called mitochondria.
text/html/html:p(2): As its name suggests, glycine cleavage enzyme processes a molecule called glycine by cutting (cleaving) it into smaller pieces.  Glycine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. This molecule also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain.  The breakdown of excess glycine is necessary for the normal development and function of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
