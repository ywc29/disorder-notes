text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>HADHB</i> gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme complex called mitochondrial trifunctional protein. This enzyme complex functions in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is made of eight parts (subunits). Four alpha subunits are produced from the <i>HADHA</i> gene, and four beta subunits are produced from the <i>HADHB</i> gene. As the name suggests, mitochondrial trifunctional protein contains three enzymes that each perform a different function.  The beta subunits contain one of the enzymes, known as long-chain 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase. The alpha subunits contain the other two enzymes. These enzymes are essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.
text/html/html:p(2): Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is required to metabolize a group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Long-chain fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils. These fatty acids are stored in the body's fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.
