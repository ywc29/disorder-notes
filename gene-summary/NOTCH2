text/html: <p>The <i>NOTCH2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called Notch2, a member of the Notch family of receptors. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Attachment of a ligand to the Notch2 receptor sends signals that are important for normal development and function of many tissues throughout the body, both before and after birth. In particular, research indicates that Notch2 signaling is important for the development of cells destined to be part of the heart, liver, kidneys, teeth, bones, and other structures in a growing embryo. After birth, Notch2 signaling is involved in immune system function, tissue repair, and a process called bone remodeling, in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it.</p><p>The Notch2 receptor has several major parts. A region of the receptor called the extracellular domain extends from the surface of the cell and binds to ligands. This binding triggers the part of the receptor inside the cell, known as the intracellular domain or NICD, to be cut (cleaved) from the rest of the protein. The NICD then moves into the cell's nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate the activity of specific genes. The very end of the NICD contains a region known as a proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PEST) domain. The PEST domain is necessary for the NICD to be broken down, which stops Notch2 signaling at the appropriate time.</p>
