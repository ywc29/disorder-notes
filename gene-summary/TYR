text/html: <p>The <i>TYR</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tyrosinase.  This enzyme is located in melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.</p><p>Tyrosinase is responsible for the first step in melanin production.  It converts a protein building block (amino acid) called tyrosine to another compound called dopaquinone.  A series of additional chemical reactions convert dopaquinone to melanin in the skin, hair follicles, the colored part of the eye (the iris), and the retina.</p>
