text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>ALG6</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation is a process by which sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats. Oligosaccharides are made up of many sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a stepwise process forming a complex chain. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. The enzyme produced from the <i>ALG6</i> gene transfers a simple sugar called glucose to the growing oligosaccharide. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or fat.
