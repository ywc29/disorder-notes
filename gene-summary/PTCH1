text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PTCH1</i> gene provides instructions for producing the patched-1 protein, which functions as a receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. A protein called Sonic Hedgehog is the ligand for the patched-1 receptor. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function.
text/html/html:p(2): Patched-1 and Sonic Hedgehog function in a pathway that is essential for early development. This pathway plays a role in cell growth, cell specialization, and determining the shape (patterning) of many different parts of the developing body. When Sonic Hedgehog is not present, patched-1 prevents cells from growing and dividing (proliferating). When Sonic Hedgehog is attached, patched-1 stops suppressing cell proliferation.  Based on its role in preventing cells from proliferating in an uncontrolled way, <i>PTCH1</i> is called a tumor suppressor gene.
