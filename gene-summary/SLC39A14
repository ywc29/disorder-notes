text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SLC39A14</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports the element manganese across cell membranes. Manganese is important for many cellular functions, but large amounts are toxic, particularly to brain cells. The SLC39A14 protein is found in the membranes surrounding several types of cells, as well as in the membranes of structures within these cells. The protein is thought to transport excess manganese from the blood into liver cells so that it can be removed from the body through bile. Bile is a substance produced by the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste products.
text/html/html:p(2): The SLC39A14 protein may also transport other elements, including zinc, iron, and cadmium, across cell membranes. The importance of this transport in the body is not well understood.
