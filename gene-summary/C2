text/html/html:p: The <i>C2</i> gene provides instructions for making the complement component 2 protein. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. When a foreign invader is detected, the complement pathway is turned on (activated) and the complement component 2 protein attaches (binds) to a similar protein called complement component 4. Together, these proteins form a complex called C3 convertase, which triggers further activation of the pathway, allowing the proteins of the complement system to participate in an immune response.
