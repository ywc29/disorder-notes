text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>HNF1B</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the protein produced from the <i>HNF1B</i> gene is called a transcription factor. The HNF1B protein is part of a large group of transcription factors called homeodomain proteins. The homeodomain is a region of the protein that allows it to bind to DNA.
text/html/html:p(2): The HNF1B protein is found in many organs and tissues, including the lungs, liver, intestines, pancreas, kidneys, reproductive system, and urinary tract. Researchers suspect that this protein may play a role in the development of many of these parts of the body.
