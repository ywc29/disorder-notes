text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SERPING1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called C1 inhibitor, which is a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins help control several types of chemical reactions by blocking the activity of certain proteins. C1 inhibitor is important for controlling a range of processes involved in maintaining blood vessels, including inflammation. Inflammation is a normal body response to infection, irritation, or other injury.</p><p>C1 inhibitor blocks the activity of several proteins in the blood, including plasma kallikrein and the activated form of factor XII (called factor XIIa). These two proteins are involved in the production of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a protein that promotes inflammation by increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls, allowing fluids to leak into body tissues. C1 inhibitor attaches (binds) to plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa, which prevents them from completing any further reactions.  These proteins are  cleared from the bloodstream once they are bound to C1 inhibitor.</p>
