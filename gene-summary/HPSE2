text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>HPSE2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called heparanase 2. Little is known about this protein, but its structure is similar to that of another protein called heparanase 1. Heparanase 1 is an enzyme that splits (cleaves) molecules called heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) by removing the heparan sulfate portion (the side chain).</p><p>HSPGs are important parts of the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix) and of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Cleavage of HSPGs by heparanase 1 may lead to changes in the basement membrane or extracellular matrix that allow cell movement or release of substances from the cell. The specific function of the heparanase 2 enzyme is not well understood, but studies suggest that it may block the action of heparanase 1.</p>
