text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>KCNE1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged potassium atoms (ions) into and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.</p><p>The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. The KCNE1 protein regulates a channel made up of four parts, called alpha subunits, which are produced from the <i>KCNQ1</i> gene. One beta subunit, produced from the <i>KCNE1</i> gene, binds to the channel and regulates its activity.</p><p>These channels are active in the inner ear and in heart (cardiac) muscle, where they transport potassium ions out of cells. In the inner ear, the channels play a role in maintaining the proper ion balance needed for normal hearing. In the heart, the channels are involved in recharging the cardiac muscle after each heartbeat to maintain a regular rhythm. The KCNE1 protein is also produced in the kidneys, testes, and uterus, where it probably regulates the activity of other channels.</p>
