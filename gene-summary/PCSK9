text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PCSK9</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the amount of cholesterol in the bloodstream. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals.
text/html/html:p(2): The PCSK9 protein appears to control the number of low-density lipoprotein receptors, which are proteins on the surface of cells.  These receptors play a critical role in regulating blood cholesterol levels.  The receptors bind to particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood.  Low-density lipoprotein receptors are particularly abundant in the liver, the organ responsible for removing most excess cholesterol from the body.
text/html/html:p(3): The number of low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of liver cells determines how quickly cholesterol (in the form of low-density lipoproteins) is removed from the bloodstream. Studies suggest that the PCSK9 protein helps control blood cholesterol levels by breaking down low-density lipoprotein receptors before they reach the cell surface.
