text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>AKR1D1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-oxo-5-beta(β)-steroid 4-dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in liver cells. It participates in the production of bile acids, which are a component of a digestive fluid called bile. Bile acids stimulate bile flow and helps absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile acids are produced from cholesterol in a multi-step process. The 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase enzyme is responsible for the third step in that process, which converts 7alpha(α)-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to 7α-hydroxy-5β-cholesten-3-one.</p>
