text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>PDGFRA</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The PDGFRA protein is found in the cell membrane of certain cell types where a specific protein, called platelet-derived growth factor, attaches (binds) to it. This binding turns on (activates) the PDGFRA protein, which then activates other proteins inside the cell by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions (a process called phosphorylation). This process leads to the activation of a series of proteins in multiple signaling pathways.</p><p>The signaling pathways stimulated by the PDGFRA protein control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. PDGFRA protein signaling is important for the development of many types of cells throughout the body.</p>
