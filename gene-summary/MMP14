text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MMP14</i> gene (also known as <i>MT1-MMP</i>) provides instructions for making an enzyme called matrix metallopeptidase 14. This enzyme is found on the surface of many types of cells. It normally helps modify and break down various components of the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. These changes influence many cell activities and functions. For example, they have been shown to promote cell growth, stimulate cell movement (migration), and trigger the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).</p><p>Matrix metallopeptidase 14 also turns on (activates) a protein called matrix metallopeptidase 2 in the extracellular matrix. The activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 appears to be important for a variety of body functions, including bone remodeling, which is a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it.</p><p>Although most research has focused on the role of matrix metallopeptidase 14 in the extracellular matrix, studies suggest that it may also be involved in signaling pathways within cells. Little is known about this function of the enzyme.</p>
