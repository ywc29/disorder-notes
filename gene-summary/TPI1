text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>TPI1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called triosephosphate isomerase 1. This enzyme is involved in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy for cells. The triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme carries out a specific reaction during glycolysis: the conversion of a molecule called dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This conversion can go both ways, meaning that the triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme can also convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate back into DHAP. Additional steps convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into other molecules that ultimately produce energy in the form of a molecule called ATP.</p><p>For the triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme to be turned on (active), it has to attach (bind) to another triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme, forming a two-enzyme complex called a dimer.</p>
