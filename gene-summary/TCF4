text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>TCF4</i> gene provides instructions for making a gene that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of many other genes. On the basis of this action, the TCF4 protein is known as a transcription factor. The TCF4 protein is part of a group of proteins known as E-proteins. E-proteins each bind with another identical or similar protein and then bind to a specific sequence of DNA known as an E-box. E-proteins are involved in many aspects of development.</p><p>The TCF4 protein is found in the brain, muscles, lungs, and heart. This protein also appears to be active (expressed) in various tissues before birth. The TCF4 protein plays a role in the maturation of cells to carry out specific functions (cell differentiation) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).</p>
