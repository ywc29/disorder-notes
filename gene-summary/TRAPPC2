text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>TRAPPC2</i> gene provides instructions for producing the protein sedlin, which is found in cells throughout the body. Sedlin is part of a large group of proteins called the trafficking protein particle (TRAPP) complex, which plays a role in the transport of proteins between cell compartments (organelles). Sedlin is thought to be located between two organelles, the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein processing and transport, and the Golgi apparatus modifies newly produced proteins.
text/html/html:p(2): Research shows that sedlin is required for transporting large proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. For example, sedlin is needed to move large molecules called procollagens out of the endoplasmic reticulum so they can be processed further by the Golgi apparatus. Later, procollagens are altered by enzymes outside the cell to create smaller mature collagen proteins, which strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.
