text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>IDUA</i> gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called alpha-L-iduronidase, which is essential for the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Through a process called hydrolysis, alpha-L-iduronidase uses water molecules to break down a molecule known as unsulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid, which is present in two GAGs called heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Alpha-L-iduronidase is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules.
