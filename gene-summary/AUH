text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>AUH</i> gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. This enzyme is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.     Within mitochondria, this enzyme plays an important role in breaking down proteins into smaller molecules that cells can use to produce energy. Specifically, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase is responsible for the fifth step in breaking down the protein building block (amino acid) leucine. The enzyme converts a molecule called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA into another molecule called 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.</p><p>3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase also has the ability to attach (bind) to RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA.  Researchers are working to determine the purpose of this RNA-binding ability.</p>
