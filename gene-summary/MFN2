text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>MFN2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called mitofusin 2.  This protein helps determine the shape and structure (morphology) of mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells.  Mitofusin 2 is made in many types of cells and tissues, including muscles, the spinal cord, and nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles (peripheral nerves).  Within cells, mitofusin 2 is found in the outer membrane that surrounds mitochondria.
text/html/html:p(2): Mitochondria are dynamic structures that undergo changes in morphology through processes called fission (splitting into smaller pieces) and fusion (combining pieces).  These changes in morphology are necessary for mitochondria to function properly.  Mitofusin 2 helps to regulate the morphology of mitochondria by controlling the fusion process.
