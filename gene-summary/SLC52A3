text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SLC52A3</i> gene (previously called the <i>C20orf54</i> gene) provides instructions for making a riboflavin transporter protein called RFVT3 (formerly known as RFT2). This protein moves (transports) a vitamin called riboflavin (also called vitamin B<sub>2</sub>) across the cell membrane. Riboflavin cannot be made by the body, so it must be obtained from the food a person eats. The RFVT3 protein is found at especially high levels in cells of the small intestine and is important for absorbing riboflavin during digestion so that the vitamin can be used in the body.</p><p>In the cells of the body, riboflavin is the core component of molecules called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN). These molecules function as coenzymes, which means they help enzymes carry out chemical reactions. FAD and FMN are involved in many different chemical reactions and are required for a variety of cellular processes. One important role of these coenzymes is in the production of energy for cells. FAD and FMN are also involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.</p>
