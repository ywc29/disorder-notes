text/html: <p>The <i>ETFB</i> gene provides instructions for making one part (the beta subunit) of an enzyme called electron transfer flavoprotein. This enzyme is normally active in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Electron transfer flavoprotein is involved in the process by which fats and proteins are broken down to produce energy.</p>
