text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CLN5</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. Cells produce a CLN5 protein that is inactive and contains extra protein segments. This inactive protein is called a preprotein. For the CLN5 preprotein to become active, the additional segments must be removed, followed by additional processing steps. The active CLN5 protein is then transported to cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. Research suggests that the CLN5 protein may play a role in the process by which lysosomes break down or recycle damaged or unneeded proteins within cells.</p>
