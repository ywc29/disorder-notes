text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>CARD14</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) a group of interacting proteins known as nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB). The NF-κB protein complex regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). The  NF-κB protein complex also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).
text/html/html:p(2): The CARD14 protein is found in many of the body's tissues, but it is particularly abundant in the skin. NF-κB signaling appears to play important roles in regulating inflammatory reactions in the skin and in promoting the survival of skin cells.
