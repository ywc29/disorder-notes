text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>MAGT1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called a magnesium transporter, which moves charged atoms (ions) of magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) into certain immune system cells called T cells. T cells recognize foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and are then turned on (activated) to attack these invaders in order to prevent infection and illness. Specifically, the magnesium transporter produced from the <i>MAGT1</i> gene is active in CD8+ T cells, which are especially important in controlling viral infections such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These cells normally take in magnesium when they detect a foreign invader, and the magnesium is involved in activating the T cell's response.
text/html/html:p(2): Researchers suggest that magnesium transport may also be involved in the production of another type of T cell called helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) in a gland called the thymus. CD4+ T cells direct and assist the functions of the immune system by influencing the activities of other immune system cells.
