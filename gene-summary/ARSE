text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ARSE</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arylsulfatase E. This enzyme is part of a group known as sulfatases, which are enzymes that help process molecules that contain chemical groups known as sulfates. Sulfatases play important roles in cartilage and bone development.</p><p>Within cells, arylsulfatase E is located in the Golgi apparatus, a structure that modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. The function of this enzyme is unknown, although researchers believe it participates in a chemical pathway involving vitamin K. Evidence suggests that vitamin K normally plays a role in bone growth and maintenance of bone density.</p>
