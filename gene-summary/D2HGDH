text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>D2HGDH</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells. Within mitochondria, the enzyme participates in reactions that produce energy for cell activities. Specifically, D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase converts a compound called D-2-hydroxyglutarate to another compound called 2-ketoglutarate. A series of additional enzymes further process 2-ketoglutarate to produce energy.</p>
