text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>RNASET2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called ribonuclease T2 (RNAse T2), which is abundant in the brain. Ribonucleases help break down RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Studies suggest that ribonuclease T2 may also be involved in other functions within cells, such as controlling the development of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and helping to prevent the growth of cancerous tumors. These potential roles of the protein are not well understood.
