text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>SLC37A4</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called glucose 6-phosphate translocase. This protein transports the sugar molecule glucose 6-phosphate from the fluid inside the cell (cytoplasm) to the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure inside cells that is involved in protein processing and transport. At the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, glucose 6-phosphate translocase works together with the glucose 6-phosphatase protein (produced from the <i>G6PC</i> gene) to break down glucose 6-phosphate. The breakdown of this molecule produces the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary energy source for most cells in the body.
