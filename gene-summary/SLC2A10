text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SLC2A10</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called GLUT10. GLUT10 is classified as a glucose transporter; this type of protein moves the simple sugar glucose across cell membranes and helps maintain proper levels of glucose within cells. However, GLUT10 has some structural differences from other glucose transporters, and its role in the movement of glucose or other substances is unclear.
text/html/html:p(2): The level of GLUT10 appears to be involved in the regulation of a process called the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation) and the process by which cells mature to carry out special functions (differentiation). The TGF-β signaling pathway is also involved in bone and blood vessel development and the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells and defines the structure and properties of connective tissues. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including blood vessels, skin, joints, and the gastrointestinal tract.
text/html/html:p(3): Studies indicate that GLUT10 may also be involved in the functioning of mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells.
