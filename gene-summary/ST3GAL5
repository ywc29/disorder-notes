text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>ST3GAL5</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GM3 synthase. This enzyme carries out a chemical reaction that is the first step in the production of certain fatty molecules (lipids) called gangliosides. Specifically, GM3 synthase converts a molecule called lactosylceramide to a simple ganglioside called GM3. Further reactions use GM3 to create more complex gangliosides.
text/html/html:p(2): Gangliosides are present on the surface of cells and tissues throughout the body, and they are particularly abundant in the nervous system. Although their exact functions are unclear, studies suggest that these molecules help regulate chemical signaling pathways that influence cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (motility), the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), and cell survival. Gangliosides appear to be important for normal brain development and function.
