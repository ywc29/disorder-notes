text/html: <p>The <i>SELENON</i> gene (also called <i>SEPN1</i>) provides instructions for making a protein called selenoprotein N. This protein is part of a family of selenoproteins, which have several critical functions within the body. Selenoproteins are primarily involved in chemical reactions called oxidation-reduction reactions, which are essential for protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules. Selenoprotein N is likely involved in protecting cells against oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that damage or kill cells.</p><p>The exact function of selenoprotein N is unknown. This protein is highly active in many tissues before birth and may be involved in the formation of muscle tissue (myogenesis). Selenoprotein N may also be important for normal muscle function after birth, although it is active at much lower levels in adult tissues. This protein  contains a region that likely allows it to bind to calcium. This region is of interest because calcium plays an important role in triggering muscle contractions, which allow the body to move.</p>
