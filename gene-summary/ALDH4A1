text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ALDH4A1</i> gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, which is found in tissues throughout the body. Within the cells of these tissues, this enzyme functions in energy-producing structures called mitochondria.</p><p>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase starts the second step in the process that breaks down the protein building block (amino acid) proline. This step converts pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which is produced in the first step, to the amino acid glutamate. The conversion between proline and glutamate is important in maintaining a supply of the amino acids needed for protein production, and for energy transfer within the cell.</p>
