text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>NSD2</i> gene (also known as <i>WHSC1</i> and <i>MMSET</i>) provides instructions for making at least three very similar proteins known as MMSET I, MMSET II,  and RE-IIBP.  These proteins are active both before and after birth in many of the body's cells and tissues.  They appear to play an important role in normal development.
text/html/html:p(2): At least two of the proteins produced from the <i>NSD2</i> gene, MMSET II and RE-IIBP, likely help regulate the activity of other genes.  Studies suggest that these proteins function as histone methyltransferases, which are enzymes that modify DNA-associated proteins called histones. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones, histone methyltransferases can turn off (suppress) the activity of certain genes.  Scientists are working to identify the genes targeted by the MMSET II and RE-IIBP proteins.
