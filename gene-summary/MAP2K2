text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MAP2K2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein known as MEK2 protein kinase. This protein is part of a signaling pathway called the RAS/MAPK pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. RAS/MAPK signaling helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).</p><p>The <i>MAP2K2</i> gene is very similar to a gene called <i>MAP2K1</i>, which provides instructions for making a protein known as MEK1 protein kinase. Like MEK2 protein kinase, this protein functions as part of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Together, the MEK1 and MEK2 protein kinases appear to be essential for normal development before birth and for survival after birth.</p>
