text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>TREX1</i> gene provides instructions for making the 3-prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme. This enzyme is a DNA exonuclease, which means that it trims molecules of DNA by removing DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the ends of the molecules. In this way, it breaks down unneeded DNA molecules or fragments that may be generated during copying (replication) of cells' genetic material in preparation for cell division. These fragments may also be generated during DNA repair, cell death (apoptosis), and other processes.
