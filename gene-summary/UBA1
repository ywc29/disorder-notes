text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>UBA1</i> gene (also called <i>UBE1</i>) provides instructions for making the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1.  This enzyme is involved in a process that targets proteins to be broken down (degraded) within cells.   Protein degradation is a normal process that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and helps maintain the normal functions of cells.</p><p>Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the cell machinery that breaks down unneeded proteins.  The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 is responsible for the first step in the ubiquitin-proteasome system; it turns on (activates) a small protein called ubiquitin.  With the assistance of other proteins, the active ubiquitin attaches to a targeted protein. When a chain of ubiquitin proteins is attached to the targeted protein, the protein is recognized and destroyed by a complex of enzymes called a proteasome.</p>
