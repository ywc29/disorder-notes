text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>GTF2I</i> gene provides instructions for making two proteins, BAP-135 and TFII-I. BAP-135 is involved in normal immune system function. It is active in B cells, which are a specialized type of white blood cell that protects the body against infection. When a B cell senses a foreign substance (such as a virus), it triggers a series of chemical reactions that instruct the cell to mature, divide, and produce specific proteins called antibodies to fight the infection.  The BAP-135 protein is activated as part of this series of chemical reactions; it transmits chemical signals that allow B cells to respond to potentially harmful invaders.</p><p>TFII-I, the other protein produced from the <i>GTF2I</i> gene, binds to specific areas of DNA and helps regulate the activity of other genes. Based on this role, TFII-I is called a transcription factor. This protein is active in the brain and many other tissues in the body.  Studies suggest that the TFII-I protein is involved in coordinating cell growth and division, and it may also play a role in controlling the flow of calcium into cells.</p>
