text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>HGSNAT</i> gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (which is often shortened to N-acetyltransferase). This enzyme is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. N-acetyltransferase is involved in the step-wise breakdown (degradation) of large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are composed of sugar molecules that are linked together to form a long string. To break down these large molecules, individual sugars are removed one at a time from one end of the molecule. N-acetyltransferase adds a molecule called an acetyl group to the sugar glucosamine in a subset of GAGs called heparan sulfate. This addition prepares the GAG for the next step in the degradation process.
