text/html/html:p: The <i>VAPB</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in cells throughout the body. Little is known about the function of the VAPB protein. Research indicates that this protein is associated with the membrane that surrounds the endoplasmic reticulum, a specialized structure within cells.  Among its many functions, the endoplasmic reticulum folds newly formed proteins and prepares them for transport within the cell or to the cell surface.  To function efficiently, the endoplasmic reticulum relies on a system that detects a buildup of unfolded or misfolded proteins. The cell's process for preventing or correcting a buildup of abnormal proteins is called the unfolded protein response. Researchers suggest that the VAPB protein plays an important role in the unfolded protein response.
