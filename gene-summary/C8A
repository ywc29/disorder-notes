text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>C8A</i> gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha subunit, of a protein complex called complement component 8. The alpha subunit is linked to another piece of the complex called the gamma subunit (produced from the <i>C8G</i> gene). These two proteins interact with the beta subunit (produced from the <i>C8B</i> gene) to form complement component 8.
text/html/html:p(2): Complement component 8 aids in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Complement component 8 combines with several other complement proteins to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which inserts itself in the outer membrane of bacterial cells. This complex creates a hole (pore) in the membrane, which kills the bacterium. This part of the immune response appears to be especially important for fighting infection by bacteria in the <i>Neisseria</i> genus.
