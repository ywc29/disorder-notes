text/html: <p>The <i>DRD5</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called dopamine receptor D5, which is found in the brain. This protein works together with a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. Dopamine fits into the D5 receptor like a key in a lock, which triggers chemical reactions within nerve cells. Dopamine signaling has many critical functions in the brain, including regulation of attention, mood, memory, learning, and movement.</p>
