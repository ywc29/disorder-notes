text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MAT1A</i> gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase. The enzyme is produced from the <i>MAT1A</i> gene in two forms, designated alpha and beta. The alpha form, called a homotetramer, is made up of four identical protein subunits. The beta form, called a homodimer, is made up of two of the same protein subunits. Both forms of the enzyme are found in the liver.</p><p>Both the alpha and beta forms of methionine adenosyltransferase help break down a protein building block (amino acid) called methionine. The enzyme starts the reaction that converts methionine to S-adenosylmethionine, also called AdoMet or SAMe. AdoMet is involved in transferring methyl groups, consisting of a carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to other compounds, a process called transmethylation. Transmethylation is important in many cellular processes. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out, regulating reactions involving proteins and lipids, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).</p>
