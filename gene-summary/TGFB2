text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>TGFB2</i> gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFβ-2). This protein is found throughout the body and is required for development before birth and throughout life. To carry out its functions, TGFβ-2 attaches (binds) to receptor proteins on the surface of cells. This binding triggers the transmission of signals within cells, controlling various cellular activities. As part of a signaling pathway called the TGF-β pathway, the TGFβ-2 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Because the TGFβ-2 protein keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way, it can suppress the formation of tumors.
text/html/html:p(2): The TGFβ-2 protein plays a role in the formation of blood vessels, the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development, wound healing, and immune system function. TGFβ-2 is especially abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate bone growth, and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix).
