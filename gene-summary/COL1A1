text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>COL1A1</i> gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type I collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, and the white part of the eye (the sclera). Type I collagen is the most abundant form of collagen in the human body.</p><p>A component of type I collagen called the pro-α1(I) chain is produced from the <i>COL1A1</i> gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Type I collagen is composed of two pro-α1(I) chains and one pro-α2(I) chain (which is produced from the <i>COL1A2</i> gene).</p><p>The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type I collagen fibers.</p>
