text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PAH</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for the first step in processing phenylalanine, which is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) obtained through the diet.  Phenylalanine is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners.
text/html/html:p(2): Phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for the conversion of phenylalanine to another amino acid, tyrosine.  The enzyme works with a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to carry out this chemical reaction.   Tyrosine is used to make several types of hormones, certain chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters), and a pigment called melanin, which gives hair and skin their color.  Tyrosine can also be broken down into smaller molecules that are used to produce energy.
