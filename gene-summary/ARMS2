text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>ARMS2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Studies suggest that the ARMS2 protein is found primarily in the placenta and in the specialized light-sensing tissue in the back of the eye (the retina). However, it is unclear what role, if any, the protein plays in early development or normal vision.
