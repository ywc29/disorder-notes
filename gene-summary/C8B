text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>C8B</i> gene provides instructions for making one piece, the beta subunit, of a protein complex called complement component 8. To form this complex, the beta subunit interacts with another piece made up of the alpha subunit (produced from the <i>C8A</i> gene) and the gamma subunit (produced from the <i>C8G</i> gene), which are linked.
text/html/html:p(2): Complement component 8 aids in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Complement component 8 combines with several other complement proteins to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which inserts itself in the outer membrane of bacterial cells. This complex creates a hole (pore) in the membrane, which kills the bacterium. This part of the immune response appears to be especially important for fighting infection by bacteria in the <i>Neisseria</i> genus.
