text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>GNE</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in cells and tissues throughout the body.  This enzyme plays a key role in a chemical pathway that produces sialic acid, which is a simple sugar that attaches to the ends of more complex molecules on the surface of cells. By modifying these molecules, sialic acid influences a wide variety of cellular functions including cell movement (migration), attaching cells to one another (adhesion), signaling between cells, and inflammation.
text/html/html:p(2): The enzyme produced from the <i>GNE</i> gene is responsible for two steps in the formation of sialic acid.  It first converts a molecule known as UDP-GlcNAc to a similar molecule called ManNAc.  In the next step, the enzyme transfers a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to ManNAc to create ManNAc-6-phosphate.  Other enzymes then convert ManNAc-6-phosphate to sialic acid.
