text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CYP27A1</i> gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family.  Enzymes produced from the cytochrome P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells.  The <i>CYP27A1</i> gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called sterol 27-hydroxylase.  This enzyme is located in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria), where it is involved in the pathway that breaks down cholesterol to form acids used to digest fats (bile acids).  Specifically, sterol 27-hydroxylase breaks down cholesterol to form a bile acid called chenodeoxycholic acid.  The formation of bile acids from cholesterol is the body's main pathway for cholesterol removal.  Sterol 27-hydroxylase plays a key role in maintaining normal cholesterol levels in the body.</p>
