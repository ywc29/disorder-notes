text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>BRAF</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus.  This protein is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions. Specifically, the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Chemical signaling through this pathway is essential for normal development before birth.
text/html/html:p(2): The <i>BRAF</i> gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.
