text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>MT-TV</i> gene provides instructions for making a particular type of RNA, a molecule that is a chemical cousin of DNA.  This type of RNA, called transfer RNA (tRNA), helps assemble protein building blocks known as amino acids into full-length, functioning proteins. The <i>MT-TV</i> gene provides instructions for a specific form of transfer RNA that is designated as tRNA<sup>Val</sup>.  This molecule attaches to a particular amino acid, valine (Val), and inserts it into the appropriate locations in many different proteins.
text/html/html:p(2): The tRNA<sup>Val</sup> molecule is present only in cellular structures called mitochondria.  These structures convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. Through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria use oxygen and simple sugars to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.  The tRNA<sup>Val</sup> molecule is involved in the assembly of proteins that carry out oxidative phosphorylation.
