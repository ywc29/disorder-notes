text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MIR146A</i> gene provides instructions for making microRNA-146a (miR-146a). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short lengths of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. These molecules control gene expression by blocking the process of protein production. MiR-146a is abundant in immature blood cells and controls the expression of hundreds of genes. This microRNA is thought to be involved in normal blood cell development. In particular, miR-146a appears to play a role in the growth and division of blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cell fragments involved in blood clotting.</p>
