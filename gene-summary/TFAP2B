text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>TFAP2B</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called transcription factor AP-2β.  A transcription factor is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Transcription factor AP-2β is one of a group of related proteins called AP-2 transcription factors.  These proteins regulate genes that help control cell division and the self-destruction of cells that are no longer needed (apoptosis).</p><p>Transcription factor AP-2β is involved in development before birth. In particular, this protein is active in the neural crest, which is a group of cells in the early embryo that give rise to many tissues and organs.  Neural crest cells migrate to form portions of the nervous system, glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), pigment cells, smooth muscle and other tissues in the heart, and many tissues in the face and skull.  Transcription factor AP-2β also appears to play an important role in the development of the limbs.</p>
