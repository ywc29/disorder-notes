text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>ATP2A2</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (SERCA2). This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that helps control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells.  Within the cell, SERCA2 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum and a related structure in muscle cells called the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The endoplasmic reticulum is a structure inside the cell that is involved in protein processing and transport.  The sarcoplasmic reticulum assists with muscle contraction and relaxation by releasing and storing calcium ions. Calcium ions act as signals for a large number of activities that are important for the normal development and function of cells.  SERCA2 allows calcium ions to pass into and out of the cell in response to cell signals.
