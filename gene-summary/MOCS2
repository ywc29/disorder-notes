text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MOCS2</i> gene provides instructions for making two different proteins, MOCS2A and MOCS2B, which combine to form an enzyme called molybdopterin synthase. Molybdopterin synthase performs the second of a series of reactions in the formation (biosynthesis) of a molecule called molybdenum cofactor. Molybdenum cofactor, which contains the element molybdenum, is essential to the function of several enzymes called sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes help break down (metabolize) different substances in the body, some of which are toxic if not metabolized.</p>
