text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>LITAF</i> gene (sometimes referred to as <i>SIMPLE</i>) provides instructions for making a protein called lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor.  The role of this protein is unclear, but two functions have been proposed.  The LITAF protein probably plays a role in processes that fight infection and destroy unwanted cells.  Specifically, this protein is thought to activate the production of an infection-fighting substance called tumor necrosis factor-alpha.  Tumor necrosis factor-alpha may also participate in the destruction of cancer cells.
text/html/html:p(2): Another function of the LITAF protein was proposed on the basis of its location within the cell. It is found in the membrane surrounding lysosomes, the sac-like compartments in cells that are filled with enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell, and recycle worn-out cell components.  The LITAF protein may help bring proteins and other substances into the lysosomes to be broken down.
