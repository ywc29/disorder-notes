text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SHOX</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the SHOX protein is called a transcription factor. The <i>SHOX</i> gene is part of a large family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures. Specifically, the <i>SHOX</i> gene is essential for the development of the skeleton. It plays a particularly important role in the growth and maturation of bones in the arms and legs.
text/html/html:p(2): One copy of the <i>SHOX</i> gene is located on each of the sex chromosomes (the X and Y chromosomes) in an area called the pseudoautosomal region. Although many genes are unique to either the X or Y chromosome, genes in the pseudoautosomal region are present on both chromosomes. As a result, both females (who have two X chromosomes) and males (who have one X and one Y chromosome) have two functional copies of the <i>SHOX</i> gene in each cell.
