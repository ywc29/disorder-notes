text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SH3BP2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unclear, although it is known to interact with other proteins within cells.  The SH3BP2 protein plays a role in transmitting chemical signals, particularly in certain immune system cells and cells involved in the replacement of old bone tissue with new bone (bone remodeling).</p><p>Studies suggest that the SH3BP2 protein helps regulate signaling pathways that activate immune system cells called B cells and macrophages.  The protein is also involved in the production of osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that break down bone tissue when it is no longer needed.  Osteoclasts play a central role in bone remodeling.</p>
