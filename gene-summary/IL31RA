text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>IL31RA</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called interleukin-31 receptor alpha subunit (IL-31RA). This protein is one piece (subunit) of the IL-31 receptor, which is embedded in the cell membrane of many types of cells throughout the body.
text/html/html:p(2): At the cell surface, the IL-31 receptor interacts with a protein called interleukin 31 (IL-31). The receptor and IL-31 fit together like a lock and its key, triggering a series of chemical signals inside the cell. These signals stimulate itching (pruritus) and an immune system response called inflammation, although the mechanism is not completely understood.
