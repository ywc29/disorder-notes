text/html: <p>The <i>VWF</i> gene provides instructions for making a blood clotting protein called von Willebrand factor.  This protein contains regions that attach (bind) to specific cells and proteins during the formation of a blood clot.  After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.</p><p>Von Willebrand factor is made within endothelial cells, which line the inside surface of blood vessels, and bone marrow cells.  The factor is made of several identical subunits. To facilitate binding to various cells and proteins, these subunits are cut into smaller pieces by an enzyme called ADAMTS13.  Von Willebrand factor helps platelets stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels at the site of a wound.  These groups of platelets form temporary clots, plugging holes in blood vessel walls to help stop bleeding.  Von Willebrand factor also carries another blood clotting protein, coagulation factor VIII, to the area of clot formation.</p>
