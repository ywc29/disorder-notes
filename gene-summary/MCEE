text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MCEE</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methylmalonyl CoA epimerase, which converts one form of the molecule methylmalonyl CoA to another. Specifically, the enzyme converts D-methylmalonyl CoA to L-methylmalonyl CoA. This conversion takes place within the pathway that converts the molecule propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This pathway is important in the breakdown of certain protein building blocks (amino acids), specific fats (lipids), and cholesterol.</p>
