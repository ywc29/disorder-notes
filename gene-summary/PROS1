text/html: <p>The <i>PROS1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called protein S that is important for controlling blood clotting. By itself, protein S cannot carry out the chemical reactions necessary for regulating the formation of blood clots. Instead, protein S attaches to certain enzymes and enhances their function. On the basis of this action, protein S is called a cofactor.</p><p>Protein S is made chiefly by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream in two forms; it is either attached (bound) to a specific protein or  occurs by itself in a free form. Both forms of proteins S can act as cofactors; however, bound protein S is less effective than the free form. Protein S is a cofactor for an enzyme called activated protein C (APC). APC turns off (inactivates) the blood clotting proteins known as factor Va and factor VIIIa. Protein S also helps an enzyme known as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) block the activity of another clotting protein, factor Xa.</p>
