text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>TMEM70</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called transmembrane protein 70. This protein is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Transmembrane protein 70 is thought to play an important role in assembling and stabilizing a group of proteins called complex V. Complex V is the last of five complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy. Complex V is involved in the final step of oxidative phosphorylation. Specifically, one segment of complex V allows positively charged particles, called protons, to flow across a specialized membrane inside mitochondria. Another segment of complex V uses the energy created by this proton flow to convert a molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy.
text/html/html:p(2): Transmembrane protein 70 is also thought to be involved in the assembly of complex I, which is the first mitochondrial complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation.
