text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>HSD3B7</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (3β-HSD7). This enzyme is found in liver cells. It is embedded in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and distribution. The 3β-HSD7 enzyme participates in the production of bile acids, which are a component of a digestive fluid called bile. Bile acids stimulate bile flow and helps absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile acids are produced from cholesterol in a multi-step process. The 3β-HSD7 enzyme is responsible for the second step in that process, which converts 7alpha(α)-hydroxycholesterol to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one.</p>
