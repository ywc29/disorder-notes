text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SQSTM1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called p62. This protein plays an important role in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. The p62 protein helps regulate this process through its role in a chemical signaling pathway that promotes the formation of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling.</p><p>Studies suggest that p62 may have other functions in addition to its role in bone remodeling. It may be involved in recycling worn-out cell parts and unneeded proteins (autophagy), the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), and the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions.</p>
