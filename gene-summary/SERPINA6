text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SERPINA6</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), which is primarily produced in the liver. The CBG protein attaches (binds) to a hormone called cortisol, which has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. When cortisol is bound to CBG, the hormone is turned off (inactive). Normally, around 80 to 90 percent of the body's cortisol is bound to CBG, 5 to 10 percent is unbound and active, and the remaining cortisol is bound to another protein called albumin. When cortisol is needed in the body, CBG delivers the cortisol to the appropriate tissues and releases it, causing cortisol to become active. In this manner, CBG regulates the amount of cortisol that is available for use in the body. The amount of total cortisol in the body consists of both bound (inactive) and unbound (active) cortisol.</p>
