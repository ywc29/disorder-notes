text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>KLKB1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called prekallikrein. Prekallikrein is produced in the liver and circulates in the blood. A molecule called factor XII converts prekallikrein to another protein called plasma kallikrein, and plasma kallikrein helps turn on (activate) more factor XII. Plasma kallikrein and factor XII are involved in the early stages of blood clotting as part of a process called the intrinsic coagulation pathway (also called the contact activation pathway). Blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.</p><p>The interaction between plasma kallikrein and factor XII also initiates a series of chemical reactions resulting in the release of a protein called bradykinin. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls, allowing more fluids to leak into body tissues. This leakage causes the swelling that accompanies inflammation.</p>
