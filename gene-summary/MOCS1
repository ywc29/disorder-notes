text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MOCS1</i> gene provides instructions for making two different proteins, MOCS1A and MOCS1B. Both are involved in the formation (biosynthesis) of a molecule called molybdenum cofactor. Specifically, MOCS1A and MOCS1B perform the first of a series of reactions that produce the cofactor, although the function of MOCS1B in this process is not understood. Molybdenum cofactor, which contains the element molybdenum, is essential to the function of several enzymes called sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes help break down (metabolize) different substances in the body, some of which are toxic if not metabolized.</p>
