text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>FIG4</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called Fig4, whose function is not well understood. Researchers believe that the Fig4 protein plays a role in regulating a compound called phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate, or PtdIns(3,5)P(2). This compound is involved in the movement of small sac-like structures called vesicles that transport certain substances within cells (vesicle trafficking). The Fig4 protein also seems to help in the survival of nerve cells (neurons).</p>
