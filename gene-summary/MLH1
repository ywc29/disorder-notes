text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>MLH1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in DNA repair. This protein helps fix errors that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. The MLH1 protein joins with another protein called PMS2 (produced from the <i>PMS2</i> gene), to form a protein complex. This complex coordinates the activities of other proteins that repair errors made during DNA replication. The repairs are made by removing a section of DNA that contains errors and replacing the section with a corrected DNA sequence. The <i>MLH1</i> gene is a member of a set of genes known as the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.
