text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>USP9Y</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called ubiquitin-specific protease 9. This gene is found on the Y chromosome. People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes are sex chromosomes, called X and Y. Females have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY).</p><p>Because it is located on the Y chromosome, the <i>USP9Y</i> gene is present only in males. It occurs in a region of the Y chromosome called azoospermia factor A (AZFA). Azoospermia is the absence of sperm cells. The <i>USP9Y</i> gene is believed to be involved in sperm cell development, but its specific function is not well understood.</p>
