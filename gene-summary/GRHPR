text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>GRHPR</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase. This enzyme plays a role in preventing the buildup of a potentially harmful substance called glyoxylate by converting it to a substance called glycolate, which is easily excreted from the body. Additionally, this enzyme can convert a compound called hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate, which is eventually converted to the simple sugar glucose (by other enzymes) and used for energy.
