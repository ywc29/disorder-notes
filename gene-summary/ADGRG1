text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>ADGRG1</i> gene, formerly known as <i>GPR56</i>, provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for normal brain development. Before birth, the ADGRG1 protein appears to be essential for the normal growth and movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) in a part of the brain called the cerebral cortex. This outer layer of the brain carries out many important functions, such as sensation, voluntary muscle movement, thought, planning, and memory.
text/html/html:p(2): Although the ADGRG1 protein has been studied most extensively in the brain, it is active in many of the body's tissues. This protein interacts with other proteins on the cell surface to trigger a series of chemical signals within the cell. Studies suggest that ADGRG1 signaling may play an important role in attaching cells to one another (cell adhesion).
