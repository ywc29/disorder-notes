text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>IGHMBP2</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called immunoglobulin Âµ-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2). This enzyme functions as a helicase, which means that it attaches to particular regions of DNA and temporarily unwinds the two spiral strands of these molecules. When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, the chromosomes are duplicated (replicated) so that each new cell will get a complete set of chromosomes. The replication process involves unwinding the DNA so that it can be copied. This mechanism is also involved in the production of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Additionally, the IGHMBP2 protein is thought to be involved in the production of proteins from RNA through a process called translation. The IGHMBP2 protein is produced in cells throughout the body.
