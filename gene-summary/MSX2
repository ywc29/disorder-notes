text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MSX2</i> gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is necessary for proper development of cells and tissues throughout the body. The MSX2 protein is a transcription factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation and specialization (differentiation), and cell survival. The regulation of these functions ensures that cells start and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.</p><p>The MSX2 protein is part of a chemical signaling pathway known as the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway. This signaling pathway regulates various cellular processes and is involved in the growth of cells, including new bone cells. The MSX2 protein seems to be particularly critical for the development of the skull.</p>
