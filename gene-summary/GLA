text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>GLA</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A.  This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures that act as recycling centers within cells.  Lysosomes use digestive enzymes to process worn-out cell components and recycle usable parts.</p><p>Alpha-galactosidase A breaks down a molecule called globotriaosylceramide, which consists of three sugars attached to a fatty substance.  This molecule is degraded as part of the normal recycling of old red blood cells (erythrocytes) and other types of cells.</p>
