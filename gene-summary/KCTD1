text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>KCTD1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor, which means that it turns off (represses) the activity of certain genes when they are not needed. A region of the KCTD1 protein called the BTB domain is essential for the protein's transcriptional repressor function.
text/html/html:p(2): The KCTD1 protein is thought to control (regulate) the activity of genes involved in the development of an embryonic cell layer called the ectoderm. Within the developing embryo, the ectoderm gives rise to several body tissues including the skin, hair, nails, and teeth.
