text/html: <p>The <i>CCND2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called cyclin D2. Cyclins are a family of proteins that control how cells proceed through the multi-step cycle of cell division. Cyclin D2 helps to regulate a step in the cycle called the G1-S transition, in which the cell moves from the G1 phase, when cell growth occurs, to the S phase, when the cell's DNA is copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. Cyclin D2's role in the cell division cycle makes it a key controller of the rate of cell growth and division (proliferation) in the body.</p><p>The cyclin D2 protein is regulated by a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including the creation (synthesis) of new proteins, cell proliferation, and the survival of cells. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain.</p>
