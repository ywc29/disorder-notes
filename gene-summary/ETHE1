text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>ETHE1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is active in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. The ETHE1 enzyme is part of a pathway that breaks down a molecule called sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in mitochondria. Sulfide is produced in the body's tissues as part of normal cell processes, and it is also released by bacteria living in the gastrointestinal system (gut).
text/html/html:p(2): At low levels, sulfide is critical for normal cell functioning. However, this molecule becomes toxic at high levels, interfering with numerous cell activities. For example, excess sulfide interferes with mitochondrial energy production by blocking (inhibiting) an enzyme complex called cytochrome C oxidase (COX). This complex normally carries out one of the final steps in the process of energy production in mitochondria.
