text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SUCLG1</i> gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of an enzyme called succinate-CoA ligase. Two slightly different versions of this enzyme are made with the alpha subunit: ADP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (A-SUCL) and GDP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (G-SUCL). A-SUCL is most active in tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as those of the brain and muscles. G-SUCL is most active in other tissues, particularly in the liver and kidneys.
text/html/html:p(2): Both versions of succinate-CoA ligase play a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Within mitochondria, these enzymes are likely involved in a series of chemical reactions known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. These reactions allow cells to use oxygen and generate energy.
text/html/html:p(3): Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. Studies suggest that succinate-CoA ligase interacts with another enzyme, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, to produce and maintain the building blocks of mitochondrial DNA. Having an adequate amount of mitochondrial DNA is essential for normal energy production within cells.
