text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>TYMP</i> gene (previously known as <i>ECGF1</i>) provides instructions for making an enzyme called thymidine phosphorylase.  Thymidine is a molecule known as a nucleoside, which (after a chemical modification) is used as a building block of DNA. Thymidine phosphorylase converts thymidine into two smaller molecules, 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate and thymine.  This chemical reaction is an important step in the breakdown of thymidine, which helps regulate the level of nucleosides in cells.
text/html/html:p(2): Thymidine phosphorylase plays an important role in maintaining the appropriate amount of thymidine in cell structures called mitochondria.  Mitochondria convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).  Mitochondria use nucleosides, including thymidine, to build new molecules of mtDNA as needed.
