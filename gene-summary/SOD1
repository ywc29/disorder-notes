text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SOD1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called superoxide dismutase, which is abundant in cells throughout the body. This enzyme attaches (binds) to molecules of copper and zinc to break down toxic, charged oxygen molecules called superoxide radicals. The molecules are byproducts of normal cell processes, and they must be broken down regularly to avoid damaging cells.</p>
