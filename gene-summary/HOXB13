text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>HOXB13</i> gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the protein produced from the <i>HOXB13</i> gene is called a transcription factor. The HOXB13 protein is part of a large group of transcription factors called the homeobox protein family. The HOXB13 protein is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of the skin. It also acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.
text/html/html:p(2): The HOXB13 protein has a characteristic homeobox region called the homeodomain, which binds to DNA, and two other regions called MEIS interacting domains. The MEIS interacting domains are thought to help regulate the activity of the HOXB13 protein by controlling the binding of the homeodomain with DNA.
