text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>EOGT</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that modifies certain other proteins by transferring a molecule called N-acetylglucosamine to them. This change, called an O-GlcNAc modification, can affect protein stability and regulate several cellular processes, such as signaling in cells and the first step in the production of proteins from genes (transcription). Little is known about the proteins altered by the EOGT protein or what effect the O-GlcNAc modification has on them. Studies suggest that Notch proteins may be modified by EOGT. Notch proteins stimulate signaling pathways important during the development of several tissues throughout the body, including the bones, heart, liver, muscles, and blood cells, among others.
