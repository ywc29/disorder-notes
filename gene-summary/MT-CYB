text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>MT-CYB</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytochrome b. This protein plays a key role in structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Cytochrome b is one of 11 components of a group of proteins called complex III. In mitochondria, complex III performs one step of a process known as oxidative phosphorylation, in which oxygen and simple sugars are used to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. During oxidative phosphorylation, the protein complexes, including complex III, drive the production of ATP through a step-by-step transfer of negatively charged particles called electrons. Cytochrome b is involved in the transfer of these particles through complex III.
text/html/html:p(2): Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus (nuclear DNA), mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This type of DNA contains many genes essential for normal mitochondrial function. Cytochrome b is the only component of complex III that is produced from a gene found in mitochondrial DNA.
