text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PMP22</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). This protein is found in the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound.
text/html/html:p(2): The PMP22 protein is a component of myelin, a protective substance that covers nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. The protein is produced primarily by specialized cells called Schwann cells that wrap around and insulate nerves. Within Schwann cells, PMP22 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of myelin. Studies suggest that the PMP22 protein is particularly important in protecting nerves from physical pressure, helping them restore their structure after compression. Compression can interrupt nerve signaling, leading to the sensation commonly referred to as a limb "falling asleep." The ability of nerves to recover from normal, day-to-day compression, for example when sitting for long periods, keeps the limbs from constantly losing sensation. The <i>PMP22</i> gene also plays a role in Schwann cell growth and differentiation (the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions).
text/html/html:p(3): Before it becomes part of myelin, newly produced PMP22 protein is processed and packaged in specialized cell structures called the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Completion of these processing and packaging steps is critical for proper myelin function.
