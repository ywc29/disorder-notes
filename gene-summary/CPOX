text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CPOX</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).</p><p>The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Coproporphyrinogen oxidase is responsible for the sixth step in this process, the removal of carbon and oxygen atoms from coproporphyrinogen III (the product of the fifth step) to form protoporphyrinogen IX. In subsequent steps, two other enzymes modify protoporphyrinogen IX and incorporate an iron atom to produce heme.</p>
