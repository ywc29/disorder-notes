text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MT-TE</i> gene provides instructions for making a molecule called a transfer RNA (tRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA. Transfer RNAs help assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins. The <i>MT-TE</i> gene provides instructions for making a specific form of tRNA that is designated as tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>. During protein assembly, this molecule attaches to the amino acid glutamic acid (Glu) and inserts it into the appropriate locations in the growing protein.</p><p>The tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> molecule is present only in cellular compartments called mitochondria. These structures convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. Through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria use oxygen, simple sugars, and fatty acids to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. The tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> molecule is involved in the assembly of proteins that carry out oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p>In certain cells in the pancreas, called beta cells, mitochondria also play a role in controlling the amount of sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream. In response to high glucose levels, mitochondria help trigger the release of a hormone called insulin. Insulin regulates blood sugar levels by controlling how much glucose is passed from the blood into cells to be converted into energy.</p>
