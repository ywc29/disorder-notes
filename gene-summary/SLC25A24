text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SLC25A24</i> gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. Proteins in the SLC family transport various compounds across the membranes surrounding the cell and its component parts. The protein produced from the <i>SLC25A24</i> gene transports molecules across the inner membrane of the  mitochondria, the energy-producing centers of cells. This protein is known as an ATP-Mg/Pi carrier because it transports energy molecules called ATP that are attached (bound) to magnesium (Mg) atoms through the mitochondria inner membrane in exchange for adding or removing phosphate (P) atoms from the mitochondria. This exchange is essential for normal energy production, the formation and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules, and protein production within cells.</p>
