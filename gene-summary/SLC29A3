text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SLC29A3</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3). ENT3 belongs to a family of proteins that transport molecules called nucleosides in cells. With chemical modification, nucleosides become the building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP, which serve as energy sources in the cell. Molecules derived from nucleosides play an important role in many functions throughout the body.
text/html/html:p(2): ENT3 is found in the membranes surrounding cell structures known as lysosomes and mitochondria. Lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells. Researchers believe that ENT3 transports nucleosides generated by the breakdown of DNA and RNA out of lysosomes into the cell so they can be reused.
text/html/html:p(3): Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. While most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (called mitochondrial DNA). Researchers believe that the ENT3 protein in mitochondrial membranes helps transport nucleosides into mitochondria; the nucleosides can then be used for the formation or repair of mitochondrial DNA and RNA, which are essential for proper functioning of the structures.
