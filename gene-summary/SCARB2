text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SCARB2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2). As its name suggests, this protein is primarily found in the membrane of cellular structures called lysosomes, which are specialized compartments that digest and recycle materials. Before moving to the lysosome, the LIMP-2 protein is processed in a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. There, LIMP-2 attaches to an enzyme called beta-glucocerebrosidase and transports it to the lysosome. In lysosomes, beta-glucocerebrosidase breaks down a fatty substance called glucocerebroside. The LIMP-2 protein remains in the lysosomal membrane after transporting beta-glucocerebrosidase and is important for the stability of these structures.</p><p>The LIMP-2 protein has additional functions outside the lysosome. In the heart, the protein is found in regions known as intercalated discs, which connect individual heart muscle cells together to form strong fibers. The LIMP-2 protein appears to play a role when the heart muscle is abnormally enlarged and has to work harder than normal, although its exact function is not clear.</p><p>The LIMP-2 protein is sometimes found in the outer membrane that surrounds the cell. Certain viruses can attach to LIMP-2, which allows them to enter and infect the cell. In particular, enterovirus 71 and certain strains of coxsackievirus (A7, A14, and A16), which cause a viral infection known as hand, foot, and mouth disease, use the LIMP-2 protein.</p>
