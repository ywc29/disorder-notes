text/html: <p>The <i>TEK</i> gene (also called the <i>TIE2</i> gene) provides instructions for making a protein called TEK receptor tyrosine kinase.  The TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (or TEK receptor) is active (expressed) mainly in endothelial cells, which line the walls of blood vessels.  When the TEK receptor is activated, it triggers a series of chemical signals that facilitates communication between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.  Layers of smooth muscle cells surround layers of endothelial cells lining the walls of blood vessels. Communication between these two cell types is necessary to direct blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and ensure the structure and integrity of blood vessels.</p><p>The TEK receptor is also found in bone marrow, where it is expressed in blood-forming cells called hematopoietic stem cells.  The role of the TEK receptor in hematopoietic stem cells is unknown.  Researchers speculate that the TEK receptor aids in hematopoietic stem cell growth and division (proliferation) or cell specialization (differentiation).</p>
