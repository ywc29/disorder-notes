text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SPG7</i> gene provides instructions for producing a protein called paraplegin, which is a member of the AAA protein family.  This protein family plays a role in many cellular activities, including regulation of cell components and proteins.  Located within the inner membrane of the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria), paraplegin is one of the proteins that form a complex called the m-AAA protease.  The m-AAA protease is responsible for assembling ribosomes (cellular structures that process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins) and removing nonfunctional proteins in the mitochondria.</p>
