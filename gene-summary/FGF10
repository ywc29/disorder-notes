text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>FGF10</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10). This protein is part of a family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors that are involved in important processes such as cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and development before birth. By attaching to another protein known as a receptor, the FGF10 protein triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that signals the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. During development before birth, the signals triggered by the FGF10 protein appear to stimulate cells to form the structures that make up the ears, skeleton, organs, and glands in the eyes and mouth.</p>
