text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ASH1L</i> gene, also known as <i>KMT2H</i>, provides instructions for making an enzyme, called lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H, that is found in many organs and tissues of the body. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H appears to turn on (activate) certain genes that are especially important for development of the brain.</p>
