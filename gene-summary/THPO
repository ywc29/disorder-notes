text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>THPO</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called thrombopoietin that promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells. This protein attaches to (binds) and turns on (activates) the thrombopoietin receptor, which stimulates several signaling pathways that transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These pathways are important for controlling the production of blood cells.
text/html/html:p(2): Thrombopoietin is especially important for the proliferation of certain blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cell fragments involved in blood clotting. Research suggests that thrombopoietin signaling may also play a role in the renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, which are stem cells located within the bone marrow that have the potential to develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
