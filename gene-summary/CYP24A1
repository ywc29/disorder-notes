text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CYP24A1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 24-hydroxylase. This enzyme helps control the amount of active vitamin D available in the body. When active, vitamin D is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes in addition to bone and tooth formation.</p><p>The 24-hydroxylase enzyme breaks down the active form of vitamin D, called 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> or calcitriol, to an inactive form when the vitamin is no longer needed. The enzyme also breaks down 25-hydroxyvitamin D (also known as calcidiol), which is the form of vitamin D that is stored in the body.</p>
