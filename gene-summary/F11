text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>F11</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called factor XI. This protein plays a role in the coagulation cascade, which is a series of chemical reactions that forms blood clots in response to injury. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair.
text/html/html:p(2): Factor XI is made primarily by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream and is normally turned off (inactive) until the coagulation cascade is turned on (activated) by an injury that damages blood vessels. When factor XI is activated, it interacts with other coagulation factors, resulting in conversion of an important coagulation protein called prothrombin to its active form, thrombin. Thrombin then converts a protein called fibrinogen into fibrin, which is the material that forms blood clots.
