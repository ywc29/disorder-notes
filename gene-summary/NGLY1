text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>NGLY1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called <i>N</i>-glycanase 1. This enzyme is involved in a process called deglycosylation, by which chains of sugar molecules (glycans) are removed from proteins. Specifically, <i>N</i>-glycanase 1 removes glycans from misfolded proteins. This step is thought to be essential for certain abnormal proteins to be broken down (degraded).
