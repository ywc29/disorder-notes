text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>FZD2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in development before birth. The FZD2 protein interacts with other proteins (including those produced from the DVL genes, <i>DVL1</i>, <i>DVL2</i>, and <i>DVL3</i>) in chemical signaling pathways called Wnt signaling. These pathways control the activity of genes needed at specific times during development, and they regulate the interactions between cells when organs and tissues are forming. As a key part of Wnt signaling, the FZD2 protein is thought to be important for the normal development of the skeleton and potentially other parts of the body.</p>
