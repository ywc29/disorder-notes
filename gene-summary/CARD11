text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>CARD11</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the function of immune system cells called lymphocytes, particularly certain types called T cells and B cells. These cells identify foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi and defend the body against infection. When T or B cells recognize a foreign substance, the CARD11 protein is turned on (activated) and attaches (binds) to two other proteins, BCL10 and MALT1, to form the CBM signalosome complex. This complex in turn activates other protein complexes called nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which are important for cellular signaling. NF-κB and mTORC1 signaling direct the development and function of T and B cells so they can support an immune response against foreign invaders.
