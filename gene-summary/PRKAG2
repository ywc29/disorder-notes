text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PRKAG2</i> gene provides instructions for making one part (the gamma-2 subunit) of a larger enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This enzyme helps sense and respond to energy demands within cells.  It is active in many different tissues, including heart (cardiac) muscle and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).  AMP-activated protein kinase is likely involved in the development of the heart before birth, although its role in this process is unknown.
text/html/html:p(2): AMP-activated protein kinase regulates chemical pathways involving the cell's main energy source, a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  The breakdown of ATP releases energy to drive many types of chemical reactions.  AMP-activated protein kinase is activated during times of cellular stress (such as low oxygen levels or muscle exercise), when ATP is broken down rapidly to produce energy.  If ATP levels become too low, the enzyme restores the balance of energy by limiting chemical reactions that require ATP and stimulating pathways that generate ATP.
text/html/html:p(3): Studies suggest that AMP-activated protein kinase may play a role in controlling the activity of other genes, although many of these genes have not been identified.  The enzyme may also regulate the activity of certain ion channels in the heart.  These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) into and out of heart  muscle cells, play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm.
