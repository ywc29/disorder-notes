text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>RGS9BP</i> gene (which is also known as <i>R9AP</i>) provides instructions for making a protein called RGS9 binding protein. This protein is found in the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Within the retina, the protein is associated with light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. As its name suggests, RGS9 binding protein interacts with a protein called RGS9 (which is produced from the <i>RGS9</i> gene). It anchors the RGS9 protein to photoreceptors and stimulates RGS9's activity.</p><p>When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in photoreceptor cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. (This process is known as phototransduction.) Once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting state before they can be stimulated again. RGS9 and RGS9 binding protein are involved in a chemical reaction that helps return photoreceptors to their resting state quickly after light exposure.</p>
