text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>AGPAT2</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. It plays a critical role in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes are the major component of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.</p><p>The AGPAT2 enzyme is part of a chemical pathway in many cells that produces two important types of fats (lipids): glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.  Glycerophospholipids are the major component of cell membranes and are involved in chemical signaling within cells. Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides) are fat molecules that are stored in adipocytes for later conversion to energy.</p><p>The AGPAT2 enzyme is responsible for a particular chemical reaction in the production of these two types of lipids.  Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to another molecule, phosphatidic acid (PA).  Additional reactions convert phosphatidic acid to glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.</p>
