text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>FAM83H</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. The protein is found in several types of cells, including specialized cells called ameloblasts. Ameloblasts produce tooth enamel, which is the hard, calcium-rich material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. The FAM83H protein is thought to be involved in the formation of enamel, although its role in this process is unknown.
