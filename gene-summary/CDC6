text/html/html:p: The <i>CDC6</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication). The protein produced from this gene, called cell division cycle 6 or CDC6, is one of a group of proteins known as the pre-replication complex. In a multi-step process, the components of this complex attach (bind) to certain regions of DNA known as origins of replication (or origins), where the process of DNA copying begins. When the pre-replication complex is attached to the origin, replication is able to begin at that location. This tightly controlled process, called replication licensing, helps ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell division and is required for cells to divide.
