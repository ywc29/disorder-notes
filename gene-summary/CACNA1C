text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CACNA1C</i> gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels.  These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.  Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes.</p><p>The calcium channel produced from the <i>CACNA1C</i> gene is known as CaV1.2.  These channels are found in many types of cells, although they appear to be particularly important for the normal function of heart and brain cells.  In the heart, CaV1.2 channels open and close at specific times to control the flow of calcium ions into cardiac muscle cells.  By changing the electrical properties of these cells, calcium channels signal the cardiac muscle to contract and help maintain the heart's normal rhythm.  The channels' role in the brain and in other tissues is less clear.</p><p>Researchers have discovered that many different versions of the CaV1.2 channel can be produced from the <i>CACNA1C</i> gene by a mechanism called alternative splicing.  This mechanism produces different versions of the channel by cutting and rearranging the genetic instructions in different ways.  Some versions of the CaV1.2 channel are more common than others in certain parts of the body.  For example, in the heart and brain, about 80 percent of CaV1.2 channels are made with a particular segment known as exon 8.  The other 20 percent of CaV1.2 channels contain a slightly different version of this segment, known as exon 8A.  This difference becomes important when researchers are studying the effects of <i>CACNA1C</i> mutations in various tissues.</p>
