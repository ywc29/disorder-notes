text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>KHDC3L</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in regulating gene activity (expression). The KHDC3L protein is thought to play a role in turning off (inactivating) genes based on which parent the copy of the gene came from, a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. For most genes, both copies of the gene (one copy inherited from each parent) are active in all cells. For a small subset of genes, however, only one of the two copies is active; for some of these genes, the copy from the father is normally active, while for others, the copy from the mother is normally active. The KHDC3L protein is involved in imprinting multiple maternal genes in egg cells (oocytes) that contribute to development of the embryo, ensuring that the genes will be inactive; the corresponding paternal genes are active.</p><p>It is likely that the <i>KHDC3L</i> gene has additional roles in embryonic development; however, its exact functions are unclear.</p>
