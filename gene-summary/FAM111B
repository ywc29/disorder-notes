text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>FAM111B</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. The FAM111B protein, which is found in many parts of the body, contains a functional region called a peptidase domain. Similar proteins containing such a domain are able to break down other proteins. However, the types of proteins the FAM111B protein interacts with and the roles it plays in the body are unknown.
