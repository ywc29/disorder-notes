text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>GALE</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called UDP-galactose-4-epimerase.  This enzyme enables the body to process a simple sugar called galactose, which is present in small amounts in many foods. Galactose is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas.</p><p>UDP-galactose-4-epimerase converts a modified form of galactose (UDP-galactose) to another modified sugar (UDP-glucose).  Glucose is a simple sugar that is the main energy source for most cells.  This enzyme also promotes the reverse chemical reaction, the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose.  UDP-galactose is used to build galactose-containing proteins and fats, which play critical roles in chemical signaling, building cellular structures, transporting molecules, and producing energy.</p>
