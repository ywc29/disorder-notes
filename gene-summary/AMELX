text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>AMELX</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called amelogenin, which is essential for normal tooth development. Amelogenin is involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Enamel is composed mainly of mineral crystals. These microscopic crystals are arranged in organized bundles that give enamel its strength and durability. Although the exact function of amelogenin is not well understood, it appears to separate and support the crystals as they grow. Amelogenin is removed from the developing crystals when it is no longer needed, leaving mature enamel that contains very little protein.
text/html/html:p(2): One copy of the amelogenin gene is located on each of the sex chromosomes (the X and Y chromosomes). The <i>AMELX</i> gene, which is located on the X chromosome, makes almost all of the body's amelogenin. The copy of the amelogenin gene on the Y chromosome, <i>AMELY</i>, makes very little amelogenin and is not needed for enamel formation.
