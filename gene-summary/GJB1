text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>GJB1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called connexin-32 (also known as gap junction beta 1).  This protein is a member of the gap junction connexin family, which plays a role in cell communication by forming channels, or gap junctions, between cells.  Gap junctions speed the transport of nutrients, charged particles (ions), and small molecules that carry communication signals between cells.
text/html/html:p(2): The connexin-32 protein is made in several tissues, including those of the liver, pancreas, kidney, and nervous system.  In the nervous system, this protein is located in the cell membrane of specialized cells called Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.  Schwann cells are found in the peripheral nervous system, which consists of nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) to muscles and sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Oligodendrocytes are located in the central nervous system.
text/html/html:p(3): The Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes surround nerves and are involved in the production and long-term maintenance of a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin forms a protective coating around certain nerve cells and ensures the smooth and rapid transmission of nerve impulses.
text/html/html:p(4): The connexin-32 protein forms channels through the myelin sheath, allowing efficient transport and communication between the outer myelin layers and the interior of the Schwann cell or oligodendrocyte.
