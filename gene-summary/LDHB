text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>LDHB</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called lactate dehydrogenase-B, which is one piece (subunit) of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. There are five different forms of this enzyme, each made up of four protein subunits. Various combinations of lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits and lactate dehydrogenase-A subunits (which are produced from a different gene) make up the different forms of the enzyme. The lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which is found throughout the body, is important for creating energy for cells. The simple sugar glucose is the energy source for most cells. In the final step of glucose breakdown, most forms of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme convert the molecule pyruvate into a similar molecule called lactate, which can be used by the body for energy. Other forms of this enzyme can convert lactate back to pyruvate, which can participate in other chemical reactions to create energy.
text/html/html:p(2): The version of lactate dehydrogenase made of four lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits is found primarily in heart (cardiac) muscle. This version of the enzyme converts lactate to pyruvate.
