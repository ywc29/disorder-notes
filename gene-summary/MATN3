text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>MATN3</i> gene provides the instructions for making a protein called matrilin-3. This protein is found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Specifically, matrilin-3 is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells that make up ligaments and tendons, and near cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Chondrocytes play an important role in bone formation (osteogenesis). In the bones of the spine, hips, and limbs, the process of osteogenesis starts with the formation of cartilage, which is then converted into bone.
text/html/html:p(2): The normal function of the <i>MATN3</i> gene is not fully understood; however, research suggests that matrilin-3 may play a role in the organization of collagen and other cartilage proteins. Collagens are proteins that provide strength and support to many body tissues, including cartilage. Matrilin-3 has been shown to interact with the COMP protein, type II collagen, and type IX collagen, which are all important in cartilage and bone formation.
