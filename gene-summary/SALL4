text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SALL4</i> gene is part of a group of genes called the SALL family.  These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development.  SALL proteins are transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes.
text/html/html:p(2): The exact function of the SALL4 protein remains unclear. Based on the functions of similar proteins in other organisms (such as zebrafish and mice), the SALL4 protein appears to play a critical role in the developing limbs. This protein may also be important for the development of nerves that control eye movement and for the formation of the walls (septa) that divide the heart into separate chambers.
