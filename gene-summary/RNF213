text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>RNF213</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein whose role is unknown. The RNF213 protein, which is found in tissues throughout the body, contains specific regions (domains) that hint at possible functions. One domain, known as a RING finger, is found in proteins that have an enzyme activity known as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Proteins with this activity target other proteins to be broken down (degraded) within cells. Protein degradation is a normal process that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and helps maintain the normal functions of cells. Proteins with a RING finger domain are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell growth and division, the transmission of chemical signals (signal transduction), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).</p><p>The RNF213 protein also contains two regions called AAA+ ATPase domains. Proteins with these domains typically regulate mechanical processes in the cell, such as protein unfolding, DNA unwinding, or transporting molecules.</p><p>Although the function of the RNF213 protein is unknown, studies suggest that it plays a role in the proper development of blood vessels.</p>
