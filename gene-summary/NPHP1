text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>NPHP1</i> gene provides instructions for making the nephrocystin-1 protein. This protein is thought to play a role in cell structures called cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells and are important for the development and function of many types of cells and tissues. Nephrocystin-1 is found at the base of cilia in cells of the kidneys, respiratory tract, and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Although the specific function of nephrocystin-1 is not well understood, it is thought to interact with a number of other proteins as part of a large protein complex that may be important for normal cilia function.</p>
