text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PDP1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1, which is part of a large group of proteins called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 protein turns on (activates) the complex by removing a phosphate group (a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms) from the complex.
text/html/html:p(2): The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This enzyme converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. This conversion is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.
