text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CYP2R1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 25-hydroxylase. This enzyme carries out the first of two reactions to convert vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D can be acquired from foods in the diet or can be made in the body with the help of sunlight exposure. When active, this vitamin is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes unrelated to bone and tooth formation.</p>
