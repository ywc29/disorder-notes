text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CEBPA</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity (expression) of certain genes. CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha is involved in the maturation (differentiation) of certain blood cells. It is also believed to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it is involved in cellular mechanisms that help prevent the cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.</p>
