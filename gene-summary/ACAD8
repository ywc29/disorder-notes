text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>ACAD8</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD). This enzyme is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers inside cells. The IBD enzyme is involved in breaking down proteins from food. Specifically, this enzyme is responsible for the third step in the breakdown of a protein building block (amino acid) called valine. The IBD enzyme converts a molecule called isobutyryl-CoA into a molecule called methylacrylyl-CoA. Other enzymes further break down methylacrylyl-CoA into molecules that cells can use for energy.
