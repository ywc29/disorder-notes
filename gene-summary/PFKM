text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PFKM</i> gene provides instructions for making one piece (the PFKM subunit) of an enzyme called phosphofructokinase. This enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. The phosphofructokinase enzyme is made up of four subunits and is found in a variety of tissues. Different combinations of subunits are found in different tissues. In muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), the phosphofructokinase enzyme is composed solely of subunits produced from the <i>PFKM</i> gene.
text/html/html:p(2): The cells' main source of energy is stored as glycogen. Glycogen can be broken down rapidly into the simple sugar glucose when energy is needed, for instance to maintain normal blood sugar levels between meals or for energy during exercise. Phosphofructokinase composed of PFKM subunits is involved in the sequence of events that breaks down glycogen to provide energy to muscle cells. Specifically, the enzyme converts a molecule called fructose-6-phosphate to a molecule called fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
