text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>JPH3</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called junctophilin-3, which is found primarily in the brain.  Although the exact function of this protein is unclear, researchers believe that it plays a role in the formation of a structure called the junctional membrane complex.  This complex connects certain channels inside cells with other channels at the cell surface.   The junctional membrane complex appears to be involved in the release of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions), which are critical for transmitting signals within cells.  As part of the junctional membrane complex, junctophilin-3 is probably involved in signaling within and between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.
text/html/html:p(2): One region of the <i>JPH3</i> gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG/CTG segment is repeated 6 to 28 times within the gene.
