text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ABCB4</i> gene (also known as <i>MDR3</i>) provides instructions for making a protein that helps move certain fats called phospholipids across the membranes of liver cells and release the phospholipids into a digestive fluid called bile. Outside the liver cells, phospholipids attach (bind) to bile acids, which are a component of bile that digest fats.  Large amounts of bile acids are potentially harmful to cells; when they are bound to phospholipids, bile acids are less toxic.</p>
