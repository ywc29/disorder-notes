text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>SLC22A5</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called OCTN2 that is found in the heart, liver, muscles, kidneys, and other tissues. This protein is positioned within the cell membrane, where it transports a substance known as carnitine into the cell. Carnitine is mainly obtained from the diet and is needed to bring certain types of fats (fatty acids) into mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.
