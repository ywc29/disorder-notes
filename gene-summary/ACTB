text/html: <p>The <i>ACTB</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta (β)-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Proteins in this family are organized into a network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. There are six types of actin; four are present only in muscle cells, where they are involved in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). The other two actin proteins, β-actin and gamma (γ)-actin (produced from the <i>ACTG1</i> gene), are found in cells throughout the body. These proteins play important roles in determining cell shape and controlling cell movement (motility). Studies suggest that β-actin may also be involved in relaying chemical signals within cells.</p>
