text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>HLA-B</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. <i>HLA-B</i> is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.</p><p>HLA is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. Genes in this complex are categorized into three basic groups:  class I, class II, and class III. In humans, the <i>HLA-B</i> gene and two related genes, <i>HLA-A</i> and <i>HLA-C</i>, are the main genes in MHC class I.</p><p>MHC class I genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of almost all cells. On the cell surface, these proteins are bound to protein fragments (peptides) that have been exported from within the cell.  MHC class I proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it responds by triggering the infected cell to self-destruct.</p><p>The <i>HLA-B</i> gene has many possible variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Hundreds of versions (alleles) of the <i>HLA-B</i> gene are known, each of which is given a particular number (such as <i>HLA-B27</i>). Closely related alleles are categorized together; for example, more than 60 very similar alleles are subtypes of <i>HLA-B27</i>. These subtypes are designated as <i>HLA-B*2701</i> to <i>HLA-B*2763</i>.</p>
