text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>HJV</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called hemojuvelin.  This protein is made in the liver, heart, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Researchers recently discovered that hemojuvelin plays a role in maintaining iron balance in the body. Although its exact function is unclear, hemojuvelin appears to regulate the levels of another protein called hepcidin.  Hepcidin also plays a key role in maintaining proper iron levels in the body.
