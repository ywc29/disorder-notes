text/html/html:p: The <i>TTPA</i> gene provides instructions for making the α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which is found in the liver and brain.  This protein controls the distribution of vitamin E obtained from the diet (also called α-tocopherol) to cells and tissues throughout the body.  Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cells in the body from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals.  Normally, vitamin E derived from food is absorbed in the intestine and then transported into the liver on molecules called chylomicrons. After a meal, chylomicrons are formed to transport fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin E), dietary fats, and cholesterol from the intestine to the liver.  Once in the liver, αTTP transfers vitamin E from chylomicrons to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), which carry fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol from the liver to other tissues throughout the body.   The VLDLs are then released into the bloodstream so the accompanying vitamin E can be used in the body.  The αTTP protein is also thought to transport vitamin E to nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.
