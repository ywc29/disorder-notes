text/html: <p>The <i>HCFC1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein, called HCF-1, that helps regulate the activity of other genes. HCF-1 interacts with proteins called transcription factors, which attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes.</p><p>A specific function of the HCF-1 protein is to control the activity of genes involved in the processing of vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin), particularly the <i>MMACHC</i> gene. This gene plays a role in the conversion of vitamin B12 into one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids), fats (lipids), and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps methylmalonyl CoA mutase carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for an enzyme known as methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.</p><p>HCF-1 helps regulate genes that are important in other cellular processes, such as progression of cells through  the step-by-step process it takes to replicate themselves (called the cell cycle). This protein also plays a role in the distribution of cells in developing tissues and organs, including the brain.</p>
