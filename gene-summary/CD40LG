text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CD40LG</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called CD40 ligand, which is found on the surface of immune system cells known as T cells. CD40 ligand attaches like a key in a lock to its receptor protein, CD40, which is located on the surface of immune system cells known as B cells. B cells are involved in the production of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins that help protect the body against infection. There are several classes of antibodies, and each one has a different function in the immune system. B cells are able to mature into the cells that produce immunoglobulin M (IgM) without any signals from other cells. In order for B cells to mature into the cells that produce antibodies of a different class, the CD40 receptor must interact with CD40 ligand. When these two proteins are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals that instruct the B cell to start making immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE).</p><p>CD40 ligand is also necessary for T cells to interact with other cells of the immune system, and it plays a key role in T cell differentiation (the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions).</p>
