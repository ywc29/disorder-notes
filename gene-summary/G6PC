text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>G6PC</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose 6-phosphatase. This enzyme is found on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure inside cells that is involved in protein processing and transport. Glucose 6-phosphatase works together with the glucose 6-phosphate translocase protein (produced from the <i>SLC37A4</i> gene) to break down a type of sugar molecule called glucose 6-phosphate. The breakdown of this molecule produces the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary source of energy for most cells in the body. The glucose 6-phosphatase enzyme is expressed (active) in the liver, kidneys, and intestines, and is the main regulator of glucose production in the liver.</p>
