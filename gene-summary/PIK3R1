text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PIK3R1</i> gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The primary function of the subunit is to regulate the enzyme's activity. Several slightly different versions of this regulatory subunit are produced from the <i>PIK3R1</i> gene; the most abundant of these is called p85Î±.
text/html/html:p(2): PI3K is a kinase, which means that it adds a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to other proteins through a process called phosphorylation. PI3K phosphorylates certain signaling molecules, which triggers a series of additional reactions that transmit chemical signals within cells. PI3K signaling is important for many cell activities, including cell growth and division, movement (migration) of cells, production of new proteins, transport of materials within cells, and cell survival. Studies suggest that PI3K signaling may be involved in the regulation of several hormones, including insulin, which helps control blood sugar levels. PI3K signaling may also play a role in the maturation of fat cells (adipocytes).
