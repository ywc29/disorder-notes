text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ALX4</i> gene provides instructions for making a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX4 protein is necessary for normal development of the skull and formation of the head and face, which begins early in fetal development. This protein is also involved in the formation of skin layers, but its role in this process is poorly understood.</p><p>The ALX4 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation and specialization (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and cell survival. The regulation of these functions ensures that cells start and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.</p>
