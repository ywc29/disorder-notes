text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ALDH5A1</i> gene provides instructions for producing the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme.  This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria).  Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is involved in the breakdown of a chemical that transmits signals in the brain (neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA).   The primary role of GABA is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals.  Once GABA molecules have been released from nerve cells, they are broken down by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and other enzymes.</p>
