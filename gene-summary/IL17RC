text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>IL17RC</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in immune system function, specifically in the body's defense against a fungus called <i>Candida</i>. When the immune system recognizes <i>Candida</i>, it generates cells called Th17 cells. These cells produce signaling molecules (cytokines) called the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family as part of an immune process called the IL-17 pathway. The IL-17 pathway creates inflammation, sending other cytokines and white blood cells that fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of <i>Candida</i> on the surface of mucous membranes.
text/html/html:p(2): The protein produced from the <i>IL17RC</i> gene is present in many tissue types in the body, and is involved in cell signaling as part of the IL-17 pathway. Together with the protein produced from the <i>IL17RA</i> gene, it forms one of several receptors for IL-17 cytokines. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Certain IL-17 cytokines attach to receptors containing the IL17RC and IL17RA proteins, triggering signals that promote inflammation and the defense against <i>Candida</i> infection.
