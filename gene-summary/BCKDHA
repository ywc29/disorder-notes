text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>BCKDHA</i> gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a group of enzymes called the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex. Two alpha subunits connect with two beta subunits, which are produced from the <i>BCKDHB</i> gene, to form a critical piece of the enzyme complex called the E1 component.</p><p>The BCKD enzyme complex is responsible for one step in the normal breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The BCKD enzyme complex is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. The breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine produces molecules that can be used for energy.</p>
