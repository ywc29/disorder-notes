text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>ALOX12B</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 12R-LOX. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes called arachidonate lipoxygenases. Most of these enzymes help add an oxygen molecule to a particular fatty acid called arachidonic acid. Arachidonate lipoxygenases add oxygen molecules at different locations on the arachidonic acid molecule, producing a variety of substances called fatty acid hydroperoxides. The fatty acid hydroperoxides are then processed into molecules that play an important role in chemical signaling within cells.
text/html/html:p(2): Specifically, the 12R-LOX enzyme helps add an oxygen molecule to arachidonic acid to make a substance called 12R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HPETE). 12R-HPETE is later converted to a signaling molecule that is involved in the formation of the layers of fats (lipids) within the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). The lipid layers are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) through the skin.
