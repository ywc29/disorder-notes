text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>TWIST1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in early development. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and controls the activity of particular genes.  Specifically, the TWIST1 protein is part of a large protein family called basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors.  Each of these proteins includes a region called the bHLH domain, which determines the protein's 3-dimensional shape and enables it to target particular sequences of DNA. The bHLH family of transcription factors helps regulate the development of many organs and tissues before birth.</p><p>During embryonic development, the TWIST1 protein is essential for the formation of cells that give rise to bone, muscle, and other tissues in the head and face.  The TWIST1 protein also plays a role in the early development of the limbs.  Researchers believe that the TWIST1 protein regulates several genes that are known to be key players in bone formation, including the <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>RUNX2</i> genes.</p>
