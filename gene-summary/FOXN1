text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>FOXN1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the FOXN1 protein is called a transcription factor.</p><p>The FOXN1 protein is important for development of the skin, hair, nails, and immune system. Studies suggest that this protein helps guide the formation of hair follicles and the growth of fingernails and toenails. The FOXN1 protein also plays a critical role in the formation of the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone where immune system cells called T cells mature and become functional. T cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to help prevent infection.</p><p>Researchers suspect that the FOXN1 protein is also involved in the development of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), although its role is unclear.</p>
