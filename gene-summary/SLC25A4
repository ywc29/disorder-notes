text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>SLC25A4</i> gene provides the instructions for making a protein called adenine nucleotide translocase type 1 (ANT1). ANT1 functions in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This process, called oxidative phosphorylation, converts adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. ANT1 forms a channel in the inner membrane of mitochondria. This channel allows ADP into mitochondria and ATP out of mitochondria to be used as energy for the cell. ANT1 may also be a part of another structure in the inner membrane called the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This structure allows various molecules to pass into mitochondria and is thought to play a role in the self-destruction (apoptosis) of the cell.
