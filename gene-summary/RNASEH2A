text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>RNASEH2A</i> gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a group of proteins called the RNase H2 complex. This complex is a ribonuclease, which means it is an enzyme that helps break down molecules containing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. In particular, the RNase H2 complex normally helps break down molecules in which one strand of RNA is combined with one strand of DNA (RNA-DNA hybrids) when these molecules are no longer needed. RNA-DNA hybrids are formed during DNA copying (replication) and are found in all cells.</p><p>The RNase H2 complex is also thought to be involved in DNA replication, error repair, and other cellular processes, including helping to prevent inappropriate immune system activation.</p>
