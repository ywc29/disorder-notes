text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ACAD9</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing structures inside cells. The ACAD9 enzyme is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I. Complex I is one of several complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.</p><p>The ACAD9 enzyme also plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that occurs within mitochondria to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them into energy. The ACAD9 enzyme helps metabolize two fats called palmitate and oleate, which belong to a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.</p>
