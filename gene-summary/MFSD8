text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MFSD8</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The MFSD8 protein is embedded in the membrane of cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. It is one of a large group of related proteins called the major facilitator superfamily of secondary active transporter proteins. Proteins in this family move certain molecules within a cell or in and out of cells. While it is likely that the MFSD8 protein transports molecules across the lysosomal membrane, the specific molecules it moves have not been identified.</p>
