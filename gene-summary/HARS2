text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>HARS2</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is important in the production (synthesis) of proteins in cellular structures called mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.
text/html/html:p(2): During protein synthesis, in either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, a type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into a chain that forms the protein. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the growing chain. Enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase, attach a particular amino acid to a specific tRNA. Mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase attaches the amino acid histidine to the correct tRNA, which helps ensure that histidine is added at the proper place in the mitochondrial protein.
