text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>YY1AP1</i> gene provides instructions for making part of a group of associated proteins known as the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. In the cell nucleus, this complex attaches (binds) to chromatin, which is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling by the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex allows cells to control the activity (expression) of certain genes. This complex also helps regulate several other critical cell functions, including repair of damaged DNA, cell specialization (differentiation), and cell growth and division (proliferation). Activity of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex appears to be particularly important in smooth muscle cells, which line the walls of blood vessels.</p>
