text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>EDARADD</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called the EDAR-associated death domain protein.  This protein is part of a signaling pathway that plays an important role in development before birth. Specifically, it is critical for interactions between two embryonic cell layers called the ectoderm and the mesoderm.  In the early embryo, these cell layers form the basis for many of the body's organs and tissues.  Ectoderm-mesoderm interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.
text/html/html:p(2): The EDARADD protein interacts with another protein, called the ectodysplasin A receptor, which is produced from the <i>EDAR</i> gene.  This interaction occurs at a region called the death domain that is present in both proteins.  The EDARADD protein acts as an adapter, which means it assists the ectodysplasin A receptor in triggering chemical signals within cells.  These signals affect cell activities such as division, growth, and maturation.  Before birth, this signaling pathway controls the formation of ectodermal structures such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and teeth.
