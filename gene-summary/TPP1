text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>TPP1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tripeptidyl peptidase 1. This enzyme is produced as an inactive enzyme, called a proenzyme, which has an extra segment attached. This segment must be removed, followed by additional processing steps, for the enzyme to become active. The active tripeptidyl peptidase 1 enzyme is found in cell structures called lysosomes,  which digest and recycle different types of molecules. Tripeptidyl peptidase 1 acts as a peptidase, which means that it breaks down protein fragments, known as peptides, into their individual building blocks (amino acids). Specifically, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 cuts (cleaves) peptides into groups of three amino acids.
