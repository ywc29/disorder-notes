text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SDHAF2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that interacts with the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. The SDHAF2 protein helps a molecule called FAD attach to the SDH enzyme. FAD is called a cofactor because it helps the enzyme carry out its function. The FAD cofactor is required for SDH enzyme activity.</p><p>The SDH enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Within mitochondria, the SDH enzyme links two important pathways in energy conversion: the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation. As part of the citric acid cycle, the SDH enzyme converts a compound called succinate to another compound called fumarate.</p><p>Succinate, the compound on which the SDH enzyme acts, is an oxygen sensor in the cell and can help turn on specific pathways that stimulate cells to grow in a low-oxygen environment (hypoxia). In particular, succinate stabilizes a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)  by preventing a reaction that would allow HIF to be broken down. HIF controls several important genes involved in cell division and the formation of new blood vessels in a hypoxic environment.</p><p>The <i>SDHAF2</i> gene is a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.</p>
