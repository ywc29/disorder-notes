text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>PCCB</i> gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme called propionyl-CoA carboxylase, specifically, the beta subunit of this enzyme. Six beta subunits come together with six alpha subunits (produced from the <i>PCCA</i> gene) to form a functioning enzyme.</p><p>Propionyl-CoA carboxylase plays a role in the normal processing of proteins. It carries out a particular step in the breakdown of several protein building blocks (amino acids) called isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase also helps break down certain types of lipids (fats) and cholesterol. First, several chemical reactions convert the amino acids, lipids, or cholesterol to a molecule called propionyl-CoA. Using the B vitamin biotin, propionyl-CoA carboxylase then converts propionyl-CoA to a molecule called methylmalonyl-CoA. Additional enzymes break down methylmalonyl-CoA into other molecules that are used for energy.</p>
