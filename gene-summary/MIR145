text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>MIR145</i> gene provides instructions for making microRNA-145 (miR-145). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short lengths of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. These molecules control gene expression by blocking the process of protein production. MiR-145 is abundant in immature blood cells and controls the expression of hundreds of genes. This microRNA is thought to be involved in normal blood cell development. In particular, miR-145 appears to play a role in the growth and division of blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cell fragments involved in blood clotting.
