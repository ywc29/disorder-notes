text/html: <p>The <i>STAMBP</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called STAM binding protein. Although its exact function is not well understood, within cells this protein interacts with large groups of interrelated proteins known as endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs). ESCRTs help transport proteins from the outer cell membrane to the interior of the cell, a process known as endocytosis. In particular, they are involved in the endocytosis of damaged or unneeded proteins that need to be broken down (degraded) or recycled by the cell. ESCRTs help sort these proteins into structures called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which deliver them to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells that digest and recycle many different types of molecules.</p><p>Through its association with ESCRTs, STAM binding protein helps to maintain the proper balance of protein production and breakdown (protein homeostasis) that cells need to function and survive. Studies suggest that the interaction of STAM binding protein with ESCRTs is also involved in multiple chemical signaling pathways within cells, including pathways needed for overall growth and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).</p>
