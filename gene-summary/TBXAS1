text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>TBXAS1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thromboxane A synthase 1. This enzyme acts as part of a chemical pathway called the arachidonic acid cascade. Through this multistep pathway, a molecule called arachidonic acid is processed to produce several molecules with diverse functions in the body. As part of this pathway, thromboxane A synthase 1 converts a molecule called prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> into another molecule called thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>. Thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> is involved in normal blood clotting (hemostasis), playing critical roles in the narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction) to slow blood flow and the clumping (aggregation) of blood cell fragments called platelets at the site of an injury.
text/html/html:p(2): Studies suggest that the activity of thromboxane A synthase 1 may also be important for bone remodeling, which is a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it, and for the production of red blood cells in bone marrow.
