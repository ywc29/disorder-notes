text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>PIGO</i> gene provides instructions for making one part of an enzyme called GPI ethanolamine phosphate transfer 3 (GPI-ET3). The other part of the GPI-ET3 enzyme is produced from a gene called <i>PIGF</i>. The GPI-ET3 enzyme is involved in a series of steps that produce a molecule called a glycosylphosphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Specifically, this enzyme adds a molecule of ethanolamine phosphate to the end of the forming GPI anchor. This step takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure involved in protein processing and transport within cells. The complete GPI anchor attaches (binds) to various proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum; this process requires the ethanolamine phosphate at the end of the anchor. After the anchor and protein are bound, the anchor attaches itself to the outer surface of the cell membrane, ensuring that the protein will be available when it is needed.
