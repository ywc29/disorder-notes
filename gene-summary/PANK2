text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PANK2</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called pantothenate kinase 2.  This enzyme is active in specialized cellular structures called mitochondria, which are the cell's energy-producing centers.  Within mitochondria, pantothenate kinase 2 regulates the formation of a molecule called coenzyme A.  Coenzyme A is found in all living cells, where it is essential for the body's production of energy from carbohydrates, fats, and some protein building blocks (amino acids).
text/html/html:p(2): <i>PANK2</i> is one of four human genes that provide instructions for making versions of pantothenate kinase.  The functions of these different versions probably vary among tissue types and parts of the cell. The version produced by the <i>PANK2</i> gene is active in cells throughout the body, including nerve cells in the brain.
