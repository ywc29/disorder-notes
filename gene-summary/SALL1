text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SALL1</i> gene is part of a group of genes called the SALL family. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. SALL proteins are transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes.
text/html/html:p(2): The exact function of the SALL1 protein is unclear.  This protein is made in many tissues, including the kidneys, liver, and fetal and adult brain.  Based on the effects of <i>SALL1</i> mutations, researchers infer that this protein plays an important role in development of the hands (particularly the thumbs), ears, anus, kidneys, and other parts of the body before birth.
