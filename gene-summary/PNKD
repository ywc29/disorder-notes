text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): Researchers have not determined the role of the <i>PNKD</i> gene (frequently called the <i>MR1</i> gene) in the human body. This gene is highly active (expressed) in the brain, which suggests that it plays an important role in normal brain function. The protein produced from the <i>PNKD</i> gene may help control the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which allow nerve cells (neurons) to communicate with one another.
text/html/html:p(2): The PNKD protein is similar to another protein that helps break down a chemical called methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal is found in alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, and cola. Research has demonstrated that this chemical is toxic to nerve cells (neurons). The PNKD protein may perform a function similar to this protein.
