text/html: <p>The <i>SPART</i> gene provides instructions for producing a protein called spartin, whose function is not entirely understood.  Researchers believe that spartin may be involved in a variety of cell functions, from breaking down proteins to transporting materials from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis). Spartin is found in a wide range of body tissues, including the nervous system.</p>
