text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CCM2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called malcavernin, which strengthens the interactions between cells that form blood vessels and limits leakage from the vessels. Malcavernin interacts with a number of other proteins to form a complex that is found in the junctions that connect neighboring cells. As part of this complex, malcavernin helps turn off (suppress) a signaling molecule known as RhoA-GTPase. This molecule plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that makes up the cell's structural framework. When turned on, RhoA-GTPase stimulates the formation of actin fibers, which has been linked to weakened junctions between cells and increased leakage from blood vessels.</p><p>Malcavernin is also involved in a process called angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels.</p>
