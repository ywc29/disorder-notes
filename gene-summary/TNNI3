text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>TNNI3</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called cardiac troponin I, which is found solely in the heart (cardiac) muscle. Cardiac troponin I is one of three proteins that make up the troponin protein complex in cardiac muscle cells. The troponin complex is associated with a structure called the sarcomere, which is the basic unit of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are made up of thick and thin filaments. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach (bind) to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract. The troponin complex, along with calcium, helps regulate tensing (contraction) of cardiac muscle.
text/html/html:p(2): For the heart to beat normally, cardiac muscle must contract and relax in a coordinated way. Cardiac troponin I helps to coordinate contraction of the heart. When calcium levels are low, the troponin complex binds to the thin filament. This binding blocks the interaction between the thick and thin filaments that is needed for muscle contraction. An increase in calcium levels causes structural changes in another troponin complex protein called troponin C, which then triggers the troponin complex to detach from the thin filament, allowing the heart muscle to contract.
