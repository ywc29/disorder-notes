text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>PPT1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1. This enzyme is found in structures called lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that break down and recycle different types of molecules. Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 removes certain fats called long-chain fatty acids from specific proteins, typically a fatty acid called palmitate. Removing these fatty acids helps break the proteins down when they are no longer needed. Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 is also thought to be involved in a variety of other cell functions, such as the development of synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs.</p>
