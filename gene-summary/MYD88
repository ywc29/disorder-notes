text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>MYD88</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in signaling within immune cells. The MyD88 protein acts as an adapter, connecting proteins that receive signals from outside the cell to the proteins that relay signals inside the cell. In particular, MyD88 transfers signals from certain proteins called Toll-like receptors and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors, which are important for an early immune response to foreign invaders such as bacteria. In response to signals from these receptors, the MyD88 adapter protein stimulates signaling molecules that turn on a group of interacting proteins known as nuclear factor-kappa-B. Nuclear factor-kappa-B regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. It also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).
