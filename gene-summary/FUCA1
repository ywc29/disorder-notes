text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>FUCA1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-L-fucosidase.  This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials.  Within lysosomes, this enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) and fats (glycolipids).  Alpha-L-fucosidase is responsible for cutting (cleaving) off a sugar molecule called fucose toward the end of the breakdown process.
