text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>TMEM127</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor protein, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too quickly or in an uncontrolled way. The TMEM127 protein controls a signaling pathway that leads to cell growth and survival. Research shows that this pathway, regulated by a protein complex called mTORC1, is blocked (inhibited) by the TMEM127 protein, although the specific action of the TMEM127 protein is unknown.</p>
