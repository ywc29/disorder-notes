text/html/html:p: The <i>FAS</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in signaling. Three FAS proteins group together to form a structure called a trimer, which then interacts with other molecules to perform its signaling function. This signaling initiates a process called a caspase cascade. The caspase cascade is a series of steps that results in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis) when they are not needed.
