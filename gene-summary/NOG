text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>NOG</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called noggin. This protein is involved in the development of many body tissues, including nerve tissue, muscles, and bones. Noggin's role in bone development makes it important for proper joint formation.</p><p>Noggin interacts with members of a group of proteins called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These proteins help control the development of bone and other tissues. In order to begin these developmental processes, BMPs attach (bind) to other proteins called receptors, and this binding stimulates specific cellular processes. The noggin protein regulates the activity of certain BMPs by attaching to them and blocking them from binding to the receptor, which leads to a decrease in BMP signaling.</p>
