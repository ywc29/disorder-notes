text/html: <p>The <i>MRAP</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP). This protein transports another protein, called the melanocortin-2 receptor (or more commonly the adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] receptor), from the interior of the cell to the cell surface. Specifically, the MRAP protein transports the ACTH receptor from a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is involved in protein processing and transport, to the cell membrane so that the receptor can function. The MRAP protein is also needed to turn on (activate) the ACTH receptor.</p><p>At the cell membrane, the activated ACTH receptor attaches (binds) to ACTH, which triggers the production of a group of hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.</p>
