text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>HINT1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1). The function of this protein is not clear. Laboratory studies show that the HINT1 protein has the ability to attach (bind) to certain types of molecules called nucleotides. HINT1 breaks down particular nucleotides through a process called hydrolysis. However, it is not known if the HINT1 protein performs the same reaction in the body or what effects it has.
text/html/html:p(2): Although the mechanisms are not completely understood, the HINT1 protein is involved in the nervous system. In nerve cells (neurons), HINT1 binds to signaling proteins called receptors that relay signals affecting nervous system function. HINT1 appears to stabilize the interaction of different receptors and regulate the effects of their signaling.
text/html/html:p(3): The HINT1 protein is also involved in programmed cell death (apoptosis), which occurs when cells are no longer needed. In addition, by blocking the activity of certain genes, HINT1 acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.
