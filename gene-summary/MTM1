text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>MTM1</i> gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called myotubularin.  Myotubularin is thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of muscle cells.  This enzyme acts as a phosphatase, which means that it removes clusters of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (phosphate groups) from other molecules.  Myotubularin removes phosphate groups from two molecules called phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate.  These molecules are found within cell membranes and are likely involved in transporting molecules within cells.
