text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>ARMC5</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein about which little is known. It is found mainly in the fluid surrounding the cell nucleus (cytoplasm), and studies suggest that its function depends on interacting with other proteins. It is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.</p>
