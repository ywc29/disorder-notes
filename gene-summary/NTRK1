text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>NTRK1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for the development and survival of nerve cells (neurons), especially those that transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons). The NTRK1 protein is found on the surface of cells, particularly sensory neurons. It acts as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. This process is called phosphorylation. The NTRK1 protein is turned on (activated) when another protein called nerve growth factor beta (NGFÎ²) attaches (binds) to it and signals the NTRK1 protein to phosphorylate itself (autophosphorylation). Then, the activated NTRK1 protein phosphorylates other proteins; this process is needed to transmit signals for cell growth and survival.</p>
