text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>CLCN1</i> gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.</p><p>The <i>CLCN1</i> gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-1.  These channels are abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contraction and relaxation are controlled by the flow of certain ions into and out of muscle cells. ClC-1 channels, which span the cell membrane, control the flow of chloride ions into these cells.  This influx stabilizes the cells' electrical charge, which prevents muscles from contracting abnormally.</p><p>ClC-1 channels are made of two identical protein subunits, each produced from the <i>CLCN1</i> gene. Although each subunit forms a separate opening (pore) that allows chloride ions to pass through, the two proteins work together to regulate the flow of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells.</p>
