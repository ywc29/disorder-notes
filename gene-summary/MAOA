text/html: <p>The <i>MAOA</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes that break down molecules called monoamines through a chemical reaction known as oxidation. Among the monoamines broken down by monoamine oxidase A are certain chemicals that act as neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain.  Neurotransmitters are broken down when signaling is no longer needed.</p><p>Specifically, monoamine oxidase A is involved in the breakdown of the neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Signals transmitted by serotonin regulate mood, emotion, sleep, and appetite. Epinephrine and norepinephrine control the body's response to stress. Dopamine transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements.</p><p>Monoamine oxidase A also helps break down monoamines found in the diet. It seems to be particularly important in the breakdown of excess tyramine, which is found in cheese and other foods.</p><p>Monoamine oxidase A appears to be involved in normal brain development before birth. The enzyme plays a role in the controlled self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), which is an important process in the development of many tissues and organs, including the brain.</p>
