text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>MCCC1</i> gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase or 3-MCC.  Alpha subunits join with smaller beta subunits made from the <i>MCCC2</i> gene; six of these pairings together form a functioning enzyme.  The alpha subunit also includes a region for binding to the B vitamin biotin, which is required for the enzyme's function.</p><p>The 3-MCC enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers inside cells. This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down proteins obtained from the diet. Specifically, it is responsible for the fourth step in the breakdown of leucine, an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins. This step converts a molecule called 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to a molecule called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA.  Additional chemical reactions convert 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA into molecules that are later used for energy.</p>
