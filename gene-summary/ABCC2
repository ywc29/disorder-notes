text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>ABCC2</i> gene provides instructions for producing a protein called multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2).  This protein is one of a family of multidrug resistance proteins involved in the transport of substances out of cells.  MRP2 is primarily found in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys, intestine, and placenta.
text/html/html:p(2): MRP2 transports a variety of substances out of cells.  For example, MRP2 clears certain drugs from organs and tissues, playing a part in drug metabolism.  Drug metabolism involves the breakdown of drugs into different chemical components allowing the drugs to have their intended effects and eventually be eliminated from the body.  MRP2 also transports a substance called bilirubin out of liver cells and into bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver). Bilirubin is produced during the breakdown of old red blood cells and has an orange-yellow tint.
