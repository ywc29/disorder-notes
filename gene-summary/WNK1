text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>WNK1</i> gene provides instructions for making multiple versions (isoforms) of the WNK1 protein. The different WNK1 isoforms are important in several functions in the body, including blood pressure regulation and pain sensation.</p><p>One isoform produced from the <i>WNK1</i> gene is the full-length version, called the L-WNK1 protein, which is found in cells throughout the body. A different isoform, called the kidney-specific WNK1 protein or KS-WNK1, is found only in kidney cells. The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins act as kinases, which are enzymes that change the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions.</p><p>The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins regulate channels in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into and out of cells. In the kidneys, sodium channels help transport sodium into specialized cells, which then transfer it into the blood. This transfer helps keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption. Potassium channels handle excess potassium that has been transferred from the blood into kidney cells. The channels transport potassium out of the cells in a process called secretion, so that it can be removed from the body in urine.</p><p>The L-WNK1 protein increases sodium reabsorption and decreases potassium secretion, whereas the KS-WNK1 protein has the opposite effect. Sodium and potassium are important for regulating blood pressure, and a balance of L-WNK1 protein and KS-WNK1 protein in the kidneys helps maintain the correct levels of sodium and potassium for healthy blood pressure.</p><p>Another isoform produced from the <i>WNK1</i> gene, called the WNK1/HSN2 protein, is found in the cells of the nervous system, including nerve cells that transmit the sensations of pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons). The WNK1/HSN2 protein appears to regulate channels in the cell membrane that can transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions). These channels maintain the proper amount of chloride inside cells, which is important for controlling the activation (excitation) of the neurons.</p>
