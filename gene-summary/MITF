text/html: <p>The <i>MITF</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called melanogenesis associated transcription factor. This protein plays a role in the development, survival, and function of certain types of cells.  To carry out this role, the protein attaches to specific areas of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, the protein is called a transcription factor.</p><p>Melanogenesis associated transcription factor helps control the development and function of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Within these cells, this protein controls production of the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color. Melanocytes are also found in the inner ear and play an important role in hearing. Additionally, melanogenesis associated transcription factor regulates the development of specialized cells in the eye called retinal pigment epithelial cells. These cells nourish the retina, the part of the eye that detects light and color. Some research indicates that melanogenesis associated transcription factor also regulates the development of cells that break down and remove bone (osteoclasts) and cells that play a role in allergic reactions (mast cells).</p><p>The structure of melanogenesis associated transcription factor includes three critically important regions. Two of the regions, called the helix-loop-helix motif and the leucine-zipper motif, are critical for protein interactions. These motifs allow molecules of  melanogenesis associated transcription factor to interact with each other or with other proteins that have a similar structure, creating a two-protein unit (dimer) that functions as a transcription factor. The other region, known as the basic motif, binds to specific areas of DNA, allowing the dimer to control gene activity.</p>
