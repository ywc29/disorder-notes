text/html: <p>The <i>SOST</i> gene provides instructions for making the protein sclerostin. Sclerostin is produced in osteocytes, which are a type of bone cell.  The main function of sclerostin is to stop (inhibit) bone formation. The maintenance of bone over time requires a balance between the formation of new bone tissue and the breakdown and removal (resorption) of old bone tissue.  Inhibition of bone formation is necessary to ensure that bones are of the correct shape, size, and density. Research suggests that sclerostin exerts its effects by interfering with a process called Wnt signaling, which plays a key role in the regulation of bone formation. Sclerostin may also promote the self-destruction (apoptosis) of bone cells, further inhibiting bone growth.</p>
