text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>RAB7A</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in endocytosis, a process that brings substances into the cell. During endocytosis, the cell membrane folds around a substance outside the cell (such as a protein) to form a sac-like structure called a vesicle. The vesicle is drawn into the cell and is pinched off from the cell membrane. The RAB7A protein plays a role in vesicle trafficking, which is the movement of these vesicles within the cell.</p>
