text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>SLCO1B3</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3, or OATP1B3. This protein is found in liver cells; it transports compounds from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body. For example, the OATP1B3 protein transports bilirubin, which is a yellowish substance that is produced when red blood cells are broken down. In the liver, bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile and then excreted from the body. The OATP1B3 protein also transports certain hormones, toxins, and drugs into the liver for removal from the body. Some of the drugs transported by the OATP1B3 protein include statins, which are used to treat high cholesterol; heart disease medications; certain antibiotics; and some drugs used for the treatment of cancer.
