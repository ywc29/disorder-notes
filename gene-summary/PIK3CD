text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>PIK3CD</i> gene provides instructions for making the p110 delta (p110δ) protein, which is one piece (subunit) of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The version of PI3K containing the p110δ subunit, called PI3K-delta, is specifically found in white blood cells, including immune system cells (lymphocytes) called B cells and T cells. These cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection.
text/html/html:p(2): Like other kinases, PI3K-delta adds a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to other proteins through a process called phosphorylation. PI3K-delta phosphorylates certain signaling molecules, which triggers a series of additional reactions that transmit chemical signals within cells. In lymphocytes, PI3K-delta signaling is important for many cell activities, including cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation). PI3K-delta helps direct B cells and T cells to differentiate into different types, each of which has a distinct function in the immune system.
