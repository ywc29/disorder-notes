text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>TIMM8A</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found inside mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Mitochondria have two membranes, an outer membrane and an inner membrane, which are separated by a fluid-filled area called the intermembrane space. The TIMM8A protein is found in the intermembrane space, where it forms a complex (a group of proteins that work together) with a very similar protein called TIMM13. This complex transports other proteins across the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial inner membrane.</p>
