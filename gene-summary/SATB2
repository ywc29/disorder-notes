text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>SATB2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the development of certain body systems. The SATB2 protein attaches to special regions of DNA called matrix attachment regions (MARs). These regions help determine the structure of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin is one way that gene expression is regulated during development.</p><p>By organizing chromatin structure, the SATB2 protein coordinates the activity of multiple genes involved in the development of certain body systems. In particular, the SATB2 protein promotes the maturation of cells that build bones (osteoblasts) and directs development of structures in the head and face. The protein also plays roles in the maturation and function of different types of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.</p>
