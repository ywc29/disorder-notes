text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>SLC26A2</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports charged molecules (ions), particularly sulfate ions, across cell membranes.  This protein appears to be active in many of the body's tissues, including developing cartilage.  Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development.  Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.
text/html/html:p(2): Cartilage cells use sulfate ions transported by the SLC26A2 protein to build molecules called proteoglycans.  These molecules, which each consist of several sugars attached to a protein, help give cartilage its rubbery, gel-like structure.  Because sulfate ions are required to make proteoglycans, the transport activity of the SLC26A2 protein is essential for normal cartilage formation.
