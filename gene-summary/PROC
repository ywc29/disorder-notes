text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>PROC</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called protein C that is important for controlling blood clotting. Protein C blocks the activity of two proteins that promote the formation of blood clots, called factor Va and factor VIIIa. Protein C is also involved in controlling inflammation. Inflammation is a normal body response to infection, irritation, or other injury.</p><p>Protein C is made in the liver and then released into the bloodstream. The protein remains turned off (inactive) until it attaches to a protein called thrombin, which converts it to activated protein C (APC). APC cuts (cleaves) the factor Va protein at specific sites, which partially or completely inactivates factor Va. (The inactive form is called factor V.) APC then works with factor V to inactivate factor VIIIa.</p>
