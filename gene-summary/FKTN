text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>FKTN</i> gene (formerly known as FCMD) provides instructions for making a protein called fukutin. This protein is present in many of the body's tissues but is particularly abundant in heart (cardiac) muscle, the brain, and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Within cells, fukutin is found in a specialized structure called the Golgi apparatus, where newly produced proteins are modified.</p><p>The fukutin protein is involved in a protein modification process called glycosylation. Through this chemical process, sugar molecules are added to certain proteins. In particular, the fukutin protein adds a molecule called ribitol 5-phosphate to the chain of sugars attached to a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.</p><p>The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.</p>
