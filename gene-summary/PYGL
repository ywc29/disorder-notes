text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>PYGL</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called liver glycogen phosphorylase. This enzyme breaks down a complex sugar called glycogen. Liver glycogen phosphorylase is one of three related enzymes that break down glycogen in cells; the other glycogen phosphorylases are found in the brain and in muscles. Liver glycogen phosphorylase is found only in liver cells, where it breaks down glycogen into a type of sugar called glucose-1-phosphate. Additional steps convert glucose-1-phosphate into glucose, a simple sugar that is the main energy source for most cells in the body.
