text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>ADAMTS13</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in blood clotting.  After an injury, clots normally protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.
text/html/html:p(2): The ADAMTS13 enzyme processes a large protein called von Willebrand factor, which also plays a role in clot formation.  The unprocessed form of von Willebrand factor interacts easily with cell fragments called platelets, which circulate in the bloodstream and are essential for blood clotting.   The factor helps platelets stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels, forming  temporary clots.   The ADAMTS13 enzyme cuts von Willebrand factor into smaller pieces.  By processing von Willebrand factor in this way, the enzyme prevents it from triggering the formation of unnecessary blood clots.
