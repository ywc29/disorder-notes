text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>TGM1</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 1. This enzyme is found in cells that make up the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). Transglutaminase 1 is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is a structure that surrounds skin cells and helps form a protective barrier between the body and its environment. Specifically, transglutaminase 1 forms strong bonds, called cross-links, between the structural proteins that make up the cornified cell envelope. This cross-linking provides strength and stability to the epidermis.</p>
