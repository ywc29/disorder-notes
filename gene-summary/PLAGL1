text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>PLAGL1</i> gene provides instructions for making a member of a protein family called zinc finger proteins. Zinc finger proteins are involved in many cellular functions. These proteins each contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains, which include a specific pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) and one or more charged atoms of zinc (zinc ions).</p><p>Zinc finger proteins attach (bind) primarily to DNA. In most cases, they attach to regions near certain genes and turn the genes on and off as needed. Proteins that bind to DNA and regulate the activity of particular genes are known as transcription factors. Some zinc finger proteins can also bind to other molecules, including RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) and proteins.</p><p>The PLAGL1 protein helps regulate the cell's process for replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion (cell cycle), and is involved in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). It is also important in fetal growth. The PLAGL1 protein helps control another protein called the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor (PACAP1). One of the functions of the PACAP1 protein is to stimulate insulin secretion by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.</p><p><i>PLAGL1</i> is a paternally expressed imprinted gene, which means that normally only the copy of the gene that comes from the father is active. The copy of the gene that comes from the mother is inactivated (silenced) by a mechanism called methylation.</p>
