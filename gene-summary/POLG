text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p(1): The <i>POLG</i> gene provides instructions for making the active piece, called the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma (pol γ). To be most effective, the alpha subunit attaches to two copies of another protein called the beta subunit to form pol γ. Pol γ is a DNA polymerase, which is a type of enzyme that "reads" sequences of DNA and uses them as templates to produce new DNA. These enzymes are important for copying (replicating) cells' genetic material. DNA polymerases also play critical roles in DNA repair.
text/html/html:p(2): Pol γ functions in mitochondria. Mitochondria are structures within cells in which a process called oxidative phosphorylation converts the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Pol γ is the only DNA polymerase that is active in mitochondria and that can replicate mtDNA.
