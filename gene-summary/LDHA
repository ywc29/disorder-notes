text/html: <p>The <i>LDHA</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called lactate dehydrogenase-A, which is one piece (subunit) of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. There are five different forms of this enzyme, each made up of four protein subunits. Various combinations of lactate dehydrogenase-A subunits and lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits (which are produced from a different gene) make up the different forms of the enzyme. The lactate dehydrogenase enzyme is found throughout the body and is important for performing a chemical reaction that provides energy for the body.</p><p>The version of lactate dehydrogenase made of four lactate dehydrogenase-A subunits is found primarily in skeletal muscles, which are muscles used for movement. Skeletal muscles need large amounts of energy during high-intensity physical activity when the body's oxygen intake is not sufficient for the amount of energy required (anaerobic exercise). To create additional energy, glucose stored in the body as glycogen gets broken down. During the final stage of glycogen breakdown, the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme converts the molecule pyruvate into a similar molecule called lactate, which can be used by the body for energy.</p>
