text/text-role: function
text/html/html:p: The <i>B3GLCT</i> gene (formerly known as <i>B3GALTL</i>) provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta 3-glucosyltransferase (B3Glc-T), which is involved in the complex process of adding sugar molecules to proteins (glycosylation). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. The B3Glc-T enzyme is involved in a two-step glycosylation pathway that results in the formation of a sugar structure, made up of the sugars fucose and glucose, on a specific location of several different proteins. The B3Glc-T enzyme is responsible for the second step, which adds a glucose molecule to the fucose molecule already attached to the protein. The <i>B3GLCT</i> gene is normally turned on (active) in most cells of the body, which suggests that the B3Glc-T enzyme plays an important role across many cell types.
