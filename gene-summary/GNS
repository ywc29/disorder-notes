text/text-role: function
text/html: <p>The <i>GNS</i> gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase. This enzyme is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase is involved in the step-wise breakdown of large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are composed of sugar molecules that are linked together to form a long string. To break down these large molecules, individual sugars are removed one at a time from one end of the molecule. N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from a subset of GAGs called heparan sulfate when the sugar N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate is located at the end.</p>
