"Infinium CytoSNP-850K v1.1 BeadChip",Illumina,"FFPE tissue. 200 ng human DNA.","Detect Chromosomal Abnormalities, Copy Number Variants (CNVs), Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). SNP-based human microarray to enables copy number calls as small as 10 kb in regions. provides comprehensive coverage of cytogenetically relevant genes on a proven platform, helping researchers find valuable information that may be missed by other technologies.This consortium-built array provides comprehensive coverage of cytogenetically relevant genes for congenital disorders and cancer research. ",Microarray,"International Collaboration for Clinical Genomics (ICCG)1 and the Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC)","It contains approximately 850,000 empirically selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire genome with enriched coverage for 3,262 genes of known cytogenetics relevance in both constitutional and cancer applications. Use of long 50-mer probes that have high specificity to the SNP target. This increases sensitivity for low-level mosaics and offers high resolution for copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH). each SNP is represented in at least 15x redundancy to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for making accurate copy number variation (CNV) and absence of heterozygosity (AOH) calls across the genome. As few as 10 consecutive probes are necessary to make accurate CNV calls, demonstrating the high performance level of the Infinium assay","3 days","HiScan, iScan, NextSeq 550","Comprehensive data analysis with intuitive BlueFuse Multi Software streamlines copy number assessment and results reporting"
"HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 BeadChip Kit ",Illumina,,"Analysis of genetic and structural variations that are most relevant to human disease. This scalable, proven solution offers substantially better resolution to detect smaller regions than fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).Detect many types and sizes of structural variation in the human genome that affect phenotypes, including duplications, deletions, amplifications, copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and mosaicism",Microarray,"International Collaboration for Clinical Genomics (ICCG)1 and the Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC)","Complete panel of genome-wide tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and markers targeting all regions of known cytogenetic importance, incorporating ~300,000 “best of the best” SNPs with the highest tagging power important for cytogenetic analysis. The result is dense coverage of ~250 disease regions, including subtelomeric regions, pericentromeric regions, and sex chromosomes, commonly screened in cytogenetics labs. Sufficient SNP coverage is provided to determine dosage sensitivity of > 800 genes.","3 days","HiScan, iScan, NextSeq 550","Comprehensive data analysis with intuitive BlueFuse Multi Software streamlines copy number assessment and results reporting"

"HumanKaryomap-12 DNA Analysis Kit",Illumina,"400 ng genomic DNA from each parent and reference samples, single or multi-cell embryo biopsy samples amplified by Multiple Displacement Amplification (A suitable MDA kit should be used for amplifying DNA from embryo biopsy samples. Customers can transition to the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit for whole genome amplification (WGA) from QIAGEN). DNA amplification needs","Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) with karyomapping enables screening of embryos (stage of 8 cells, 2 days after feritilization) for the likelihood of carrying the defective gene prior to transfer to the uterus. This method uses SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) array technology to confirm the presence or absence of a specific allele.(Current preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) methods for single-gene disorders examine the inheritance of short tandem repeats (STRs) adjacent to the disorder’s specific loci. STR methods are expensive and time-consuming because they are developed for each individual case.) It has been banned in some countries such as switzerland, Ireland,  and Austria.",Microarray,,"Targets ~300,000 of the most informative markers in the genome for efficient genome-wide coverage. Karyomapping uses biomarkers within the genome to assess the likelihood of an embryo carrying a gene variant involved in a single-gene disorder.","2 days","iScan, NextSeq 550","BlueFuse software provides molecular cytogenetic and in vitro fertilization (IVF) data analysis in a single framework"
