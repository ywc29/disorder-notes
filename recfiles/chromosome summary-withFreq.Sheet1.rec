text-list: text text-role html   description html:p Humans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two    copies of chromosome 1, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the    pairs. Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome, spanning about 249 million    DNA building blocks (base pairs) and representing approximately 8 percent of the    total DNA in cells.   html:p Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research.    Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on    each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 1 likely    contains 2,000 to 2,100 genes that provide instructions for making proteins.    These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.

Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within    the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA. This    genetic material is known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. In humans,    mitochondrial DNA spans about 16,500 DNA building blocks (base pairs),    representing a small fraction of the total DNA in cells.   html:p Mitochondrial DNA contains 37 genes, all of which are essential for normal    mitochondrial function. Thirteen of these genes provide instructions for making    enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation is a    process that uses oxygen and simple sugars to create adenosine triphosphate    (ATP), the cell's main energy source. The remaining genes provide instructions    for making molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which    are chemical cousins of DNA. These types of RNA help assemble protein building    blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins.

ghr-page: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X
text-list: text text-role html   description html:p The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in humans (the other is the Y    chromosome). The sex chromosomes form one of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes    in each cell. The X chromosome spans about 155 million DNA building blocks (base    pairs) and represents approximately 5 percent of the total DNA in cells.   html:p Each person normally has one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Females have    two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Early in    embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and    permanently inactivated in cells other than egg cells. This phenomenon is called    X-inactivation or lyonization. X-inactivation ensures that females, like males,    have one functional copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. Because    X-inactivation is random, in normal females the X chromosome inherited from the    mother is active in some cells, and the X chromosome inherited from the father    is active in other cells.   html:p Some genes on the X chromosome escape X-inactivation. Many of these genes are    located at the ends of each arm of the X chromosome in areas known as the    pseudoautosomal regions. Although many genes are unique to the X chromosome,    genes in the pseudoautosomal regions are present on both sex chromosomes. As a    result, men and women each have two functional copies of these genes. Many genes    in the pseudoautosomal regions are essential for normal development.   html:p Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research.    Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on    each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. The X chromosome likely    contains 800 to 900 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These    proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.
