Services_provide: Ancestry service (79GBP) Health + Ancestry service (149 GBP) (can review the DNA result regularly, for genetic traits info and health risk) (remarks: raw data feature is suitably only for informational use and not for medical, diagnostic or other use. Consult with a healthcare professional before making any major changes in lifestyle) (The test does not cover the variants that maybe more common in people of Asian descent)All saliva samples are processed in labs in the United States that meet local regulations. Once participants answer online survey questions, researchers link their genetic data to study topics from ancestry, to traits, to disease. These contributions help drive scientific discoveries. The choice to opt into or out of research is always up to the participant. 23andMe is the first and only genetic service available directly to consumers that includes reports that meet FDA standards.
Sequencing_platform: Genotyping. The technology 23andMe uses looks for specific typos (variants) in the gene instructions (called SNPs or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). This approach to testing, called genotyping, is not designed to identify all potential variants.Once our lab receives your sample, DNA is extracted from cells contained in your saliva. The lab then copies the DNA many times—a process called amplification—duplicating the tiny amount extracted from your saliva until there is enough to be genotyped.In order to be genotyped, the amplified DNA is“cut”into smaller pieces, which are then applied to our DNA chip (also known as a microarray), a small glass slide with millions of microscopic“beads”on its surface. Each bead is attached to a“probe,"a bit of DNA that matches one of the genetic variants that we test. The cut pieces of your DNA stick to the matching DNA probes. A fluorescent label on each probe identifies which version of that genetic variant your DNA corresponds to. Genotyping Chips manufactured by Illumina and customed designed

Services_provide: 90% of the samples MGZ analyzes with the CytoSNP-850K BeadChip are postnatal. These analyses help identify the causes of autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability (ID), dysmorphic features, or neurological disorders such as epilepsy. MGZ also performs prenatal analysis with conventional karyotyping, chromosomal microarrays, and noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for chromosomal aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). Uses the MiSeq and NextSeq®500 Systems to run a large number of custom panels to identify variants associated with rare hereditary diseases and the TruSight Cancer Sequencing Panel, which targets 94 genes with suspected associations to common and rare cancers. The sequencing panel also includes 284 SNPs suspected to correlate with cancer through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).The TruSight Cancer Sequencing Panel is a test method that anyonecan adapt easily in their laboratory,”Dr. Benet-Pagès said.“It’s easy to implement in automated workflows and performs with high repeatability and reproducibility. The TruSight Cancer Panel enables us to analyze more genes in a single workflow than previous technologies. The advantage is that we can identify potential mutations in cancer associated genes not primarily tested.

Address: The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay is an FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) next-generation sequencing test designed to detect 139 CFTR variants as defined in the CFTR2 database. Other methods test only for those variants most commonly found in Caucasians, potentially missing CF-causing variants across broader ethnic groups. The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay offers the largest CF variant panel to overcome this bias and provide comprehensive detection across diverse demographics. The test is intended for carrier screening in adults of reproductive age, in confirmatory diagnostic testing of newborns and children, and as an initial test to aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cystic fibrosis. The results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other available laboratory and clinical information. This test is not indicated for use for newborn screening, fetal diagnostic testing, pre-implantation testing, or for stand-alone diagnostic purposes.

Services_provide: 250ng genomic DNA isolated from human peripheral whole blood specimens collected in K2EDTA
Sequencing_platform: Cystic Fibrosis testing
Sample_collected: SBS: sequencing by synthesis
Address: The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay is the first FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) next-generation sequencing (NGS) test designed to sequence all protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the CFTR gene, including two large deletions, two deep intronic mutations, and indels in homopolymeric regions such as the 2184delA deletion. The assay also automatically detects polyTG/polyT variants. Viewing the CFTR sequence eliminates any bias inherent in existing cystic fibrosis (CF) panels. As a result, the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay can uncover rare mutations not accounted for in standard tests. Capture all variants in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the CFTR gene. Deep coverage (3,000×) allows detection accuracy with a Positive Agreement (PA) of 99.66%* The test is intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cystic fibrosis (CF). This assay is most appropriate when the patient has an atypical or non-classic presentation of CF or when other mutation panels have failed to identify both causative mutations. The results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other available information including clinical symptoms, other diagnostic tests, and family history. This test is not indicated for use for stand-alone diagnostic purposes, fetal diagnostic testing, preimplantation testing, carrier screening, newborn screening, or population screening.

Sequencing_platform: Targeted Sequencing cancer diagnostic service. XNA-PCR
Sample_collected: Proprietary primer-dimer removal technology
Address: OptiSeq™Pan-Cancer Panel is designed to target 2,900 commonly observed mutational positions (hotspots) from 65 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This panel contains a single pool of 601 primer pairs and the average amplicon length is 145 bp–perfectly suitable for ctDNA and FFDNA sequencing.As low as 1% VAF detection. Streamlined workflow with no deep sequencing needed. DiaCarta’s OptiSeq™Next-Gen sequencing platform removes the cost and time barriers by reducing the sequencing depth by a factor of up to 100X and enabling ultra-sensitive detection of genetic mutations. The platform combines with the proprietary XNA technology that only hybridizes the wild-type template. That way, only the mutant template is amplified and sequenced. 500 sequencing reads on the OptiSeq™platform are equivalent to 50,000 reads without using the platform.Ability to detect below 0.1% mutations

Sample_collected: The DANSR assay technology specifically targets just the chromosomes of interest for deep, directed analysis.1 This reduces complexity of unutilized sequencing data compared to massively parallel shotgun sequencing (MPSS) techniques.1, In practice, DANSR assay technology significantly improves assay efficiency and reduces overall test cost.2  Together the DANSR assay and FORTE algorithm are optimized to provide a streamlined workflow.The Harmony test uses SNPs to analyze and report fetal fraction for every sample. SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation between individuals, with a normal occurrence of one in every 300 nucleotides.4,5 Detection of these variations allows for accurate determination of fetal fraction.

Country: * Depends largely how the library is prepared. Library preparation is a critical step in the WGS workflow.  DNA is first fragmented to the appropriate size, after which platform-specific adapters are added. PCR-free workflows are preferred for WGS, but in cases where input DNA is limited or is of poor quality, library amplification has to be performed. WGS library construction protocols typically include a size-selection step as libraries with a narrow fragment distribution are generally preferred. After sequencing, the sequence reads are aligned against a reference genome (reference-guided sequence assembly), or when no such reference is available, compared to each other and assembled into long contiguous segments (de novo sequencing).
