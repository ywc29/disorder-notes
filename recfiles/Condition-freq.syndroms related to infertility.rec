Men    seem to be affected more often than women, possibly due to some combination of    differences in dietary iron consumption and women's shedding of excess iron    through blood loss in menstruation and childbirth.The prevalence of increased    iron stores in people of African descent in other parts of the world is unknown;    however, these individuals may be at higher risk of developing mildly increased    iron stores than are people of European background.

Estimates of its prevalence vary widely because several    other disorders, as well as other factors such as certain medications, can    result in similar tremors. In addition, mild cases are often not brought to    medical attention, or may not be detected in clinical exams that do not include    the particular circumstances in which an individual's tremor occurs. Severe    cases are often misdiagnosed as Parkinson disease.                                                                                  Ethylmalonic encephalopathy https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ethylmalonic-encephalopathy About 70 individuals with this condition have been identified worldwide,    mostly in Mediterranean and Arab populations. Although ethylmalonic    encephalopathy appears to be very rare, researchers suggest that some cases have    been misdiagnosed as other neurological disorders.                                          Ewing sarcoma https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ewing-sarcoma Approximately 3 per 1 million children each year are diagnosed with a Ewing  尤文氏肉瘤  sarcoma. It is estimated that, in the United States, 250 children are diagnosed  (bone tumor)  with one of these types of tumor each year. Ewing sarcoma accounts for about    1.5 percent of all childhood cancers, and it is the second most common type of    bone tumor in children (the most common type of bone cancer is called    osteosarcoma).                                                              Fabry disease https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/fabry-disease Fabry disease affects an estimated 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 males. This  Fabry氏症  disorder also occurs in females, although the prevalence is unknown. Milder,  法布瑞氏症  late-onset forms of the disorder are probably more common than the classic,    severe form.                                          Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/facioscapulohumeral-muscular-dystrophy Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has an estimated prevalence of 1 in  面肩胛肱肌失養症  20,000 people.

Factor V deficiency https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-v-deficiency Factor V deficiency affects an estimated 1 in 1 million people. This  第五凝血因子缺乏症  condition is more common in countries such as Iran and southern India, where it    occurs up to ten times more frequently than in western countries.                                  Factor V Leiden thrombophilia https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-v-leiden-thrombophilia Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited form of thrombophilia. Between  (Blood)  3 and 8 percent of people with European ancestry carry one copy of the factor V    Leiden mutation in each cell, and about 1 in 5,000 people have two copies of    the mutation. The mutation is less common in other populations.                                                                                  Factor VII deficiency https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-vii-deficiency Factor VII deficiency is estimated to affect 1 in 300,000 to 1 in 500,000  第七凝血因子缺乏症  people.

Factor XI deficiency https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-xi-deficiency Factor XI deficiency is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 1 million  (Blood)  people worldwide. The severe deficiency disorder is much more common in people    with central and eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry, occurring in    about 1 in 450 individuals in that population. Researchers suggest that the    actual prevalence of factor XI deficiency may be higher than reported, because    mild cases of the disorder often do not come to medical attention.                                                              Factor XIII deficiency https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-xiii-deficiency Inherited factor XIII deficiency affects 1 to 3 per million people  (Blood)  worldwide. Researchers suspect that mild factor XIII deficiency, including the    acquired form of the disorder, is underdiagnosed because many affected people    never have a major episode of abnormal bleeding that would lead to a diagnosis.

Type 2 is the most common form, with more than 500    cases reported in the medical literature. Women tend to be diagnosed with    familial partial lipodystrophy more often than men, probably because a loss of    fat from the hips and limbs is more easily recognized in women, and    complications such as diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia occur more commonly in    women.

Although    cardiomyopathy is a relatively common condition, restrictive cardiomyopathy, in    which relaxation of the heart muscle is impaired, is the least common type. Some    other forms of cardiomyopathy involve a weak or enlarged heart muscle with    impaired contraction. In the United States and in Europe, restrictive    cardiomyopathy accounts for less than five percent of all cardiomyopathies. The    proportion of restrictive cardiomyopathy that runs in families is not known.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is widely distributed, occurring in many    ethnic groups around the world. It is believed to affect between 1 in 5,000 and    1 in 10,000 people.

Hereditary thrombophilia, Protein C deficiency    先天性血栓形成體質                Hereditary xanthinuria https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-xanthinuria The combined incidence of hereditary xanthinuria types I and II is  遺傳性黃嘌呤尿症  estimated to be about 1 in 69,000 people worldwide. However, researchers suspect    that the true incidence may be higher because some affected individuals have no    symptoms and are never diagnosed with the condition. Hereditary xanthinuria    appears to be more common in people of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ancestry.    About 150 cases of this condition have been reported in the medical literature.                                                                          Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a rare disorder in most populations and is    estimated to affect 1 in 500,000 to 1,000,000 individuals worldwide. Type 1 is    more common in Puerto Rico, particularly in the northwestern part of the island    where about 1 in 1,800 people are affected. Type 3 is common in people from    central Puerto Rico. Groups of affected individuals have been identified in many    other regions, including India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe.                                                                                          Heterotaxy syndrome https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/heterotaxy-syndrome The prevalence of heterotaxy syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 people  異源性綜合症  worldwide. However, researchers suspect that the condition is underdiagnosed,    and so it may actually be more common than this. Heterotaxy syndrome accounts    for approximately 3 percent of all congenital heart defects. For reasons that    are unknown, the condition appears to be more common in Asian populations than    in North America and Europe. Recent studies report that in the United States,    the condition occurs more frequently in children born to black or Hispanic    mothers than in children born to white mothers.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis The incidence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in North America and Europe  幼年特發性關節炎  is estimated to be 4 to 16 in 10,000 children. One in 1,000, or approximately    294,000, children in the United States are affected. The most common type of    juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the United States is oligoarticular juvenile    idiopathic arthritis, which accounts for about half of all cases. For reasons    that are unclear, females seem to be affected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis    somewhat more frequently than males. However, in enthesitis-related juvenile    idiopathic arthritis males are affected more often than females. The incidence    of juvenile idiopathic arthritis varies across different populations and ethnic    groups.

Prostate cancer https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/prostate-cancer About 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some time during  前列腺癌  their life. In addition, studies indicate that many older men have undiagnosed    prostate cancer that is non-aggressive and unlikely to cause symptoms or affect    their lifespan. While most men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die    from it, this common cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death    among men in the United States.More than 60 percent of prostate cancers are    diagnosed after age 65, and the disorder is rare before age 40. In the United    States, African Americans have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer than    do men of other ethnic backgrounds, and they also have a higher risk of dying    from the disease.

Synpolydactyly(SPD)    多指症        Systemic lupus erythematosus https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/systemic-lupus-erythematosus SLE has been estimated to affect between 322,000 and 1.5 million people in  系统性红斑狼疮  the United States. The exact prevalence is difficult to determine because many    of the signs and symptoms of SLE resemble those of other disorders. Diagnosis    may be delayed for years, and the condition may never be diagnosed in some    affected individuals. Females develop SLE about nine times more often than    males. It is most common in younger women, peaking during the childbearing    years; however, 20 percent of SLE cases occur in people over age 50.For unknown    reasons, in industrialized Western countries SLE has become 10 times more common    over the past 50 years. The prevalence of SLE in Africa and Asia is believed to    be much lower than in Western nations; however, in industrialized Western    countries, people of African and Asian descent are two to four times more likely    to develop SLE than are people of European descent. Researchers suggest that    factors such as ethnic mixing, tobacco use in industrialized countries, and the    different types of infections people acquire in different regions may contribute    to these differences. For example malaria, which occurs often in tropical    regions, is thought to be protective against SLE, while the Epstein-Barr virus,    more common in the West, increases SLE risk.

In 2015, more than 23 million people in the United    States had diagnosed diabetes and an additional 7 million people likely had    undiagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, and the    disease currently affects more than 20 percent of Americans over age 65. It is    the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.The risk of diabetes    varies by ethnic and geographic background. In the United States, the disease is    most common in Native Americans and Alaska Natives.

# NOTE: Androgenetic alopecia
# NOTE: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgenetic-alopecia
difficult_to_pregnant: a common form of hair loss in both men and women. In men, this condition is also known as male-pattern baldness. Hair is lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Over time, the hairline recedes to form a characteristic"M"shape. Hair also thins at the crown (near the top of the head), often progressing to partial or complete baldness.The pattern of hair loss in women differs from male-pattern baldness. In women, the hair becomes thinner all over the head, and the hairline does not recede. Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness.Androgenetic alopecia in men has been associated with several other medical conditions including coronary heart disease and enlargement of the prostate. Additionally, prostate cancer, disorders of insulin resistance (such as diabetes and obesity), and high blood pressure (hypertension) have been related to androgenetic alopecia. In women, this form of hair loss is associated with an increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by a hormonal imbalance that can lead to irregular menstruation, acne, excess hair elsewhere on the body (hirsutism), and weight gain.

People with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors; they see only black, white, and shades of gray. Incomplete achromatopsia is a milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination. Achromatopsia also involves other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity). Affected individuals can also have farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less commonly, nearsightedness (myopia). These vision problems develop in the first few months of life.

Syndroms_correlate_with_infertility: Age-related macular degeneration  https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration
difficult_to_pregnant: A leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time. Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.

These eye abnormalities may cause blindness in affected individuals.

Aniridia can cause reduction in the sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). can also have other eye problems. Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) typically appears in late childhood or early adolescence. Clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts), occur in 50 percent to 85 percent of people with aniridia. In about 10 percent of affected people, the structures that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves) are underdeveloped. Individuals with aniridia may also have involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) or underdevelopment of the region at the back of the eye responsible for sharp central vision (foveal hypoplasia). Many of these eye problems contribute to progressive vision loss in affected individuals. The severity of symptoms is typically the same in both eyes.

Their eyes also have trouble adapting from bright light to dark conditions, such as when driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day. Some people with bradyopsia also have difficulty seeing some moving objects, particularly small objects moving against a bright background. As a result, they often have trouble watching or participating in sports with a ball, such as soccer or tennis. People with bradyopsia can have reduced sharpness (acuity) of vision, although acuity may depend on the conditions under which vision is tested. Visual acuity may appear to be severely affected if it is tested under bright lights, but it can be near normal if tested in a dim environment. The ability to see colors and distinguish between them is normal.

difficult_to_pregnant: Red-green color vision defects are the most common form of color vision deficiency. Affected individuals have trouble distinguishing between some shades of red, yellow, and green. Blue-yellow color vision defects (also called tritan defects), which are rarer, cause problems with differentiating shades of blue and green and cause difficulty distinguishing dark blue from black. These two forms of color vision deficiency disrupt color perception but do not affect the sharpness of vision (visual acuity). A less common and more severe form of color vision deficiency called blue cone monochromacy causes very poor visual acuity and severely reduced color vision. Affected individuals have additional vision problems, which can include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and nearsightedness (myopia). Blue cone monochromacy is sometimes considered to be a form of achromatopsia, a disorder characterized by a partial or total lack of color vision with other vision problems.

The first signs and symptoms of cone-rod dystrophy, which often occur in childhood, are usually decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). These features are typically followed by impaired color vision (dyschromatopsia), blind spots (scotomas) in the center of the visual field, and partial side (peripheral) vision loss. Over time, affected individuals develop night blindness and a worsening of their peripheral vision, which can limit independent mobility. Decreasing visual acuity makes reading increasingly difficult and most affected individuals are legally blind by mid-adulthood.

These corneal abnormalities, which worsen over time, can lead to nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision that cannot be improved with corrective lenses (irregular astigmatism), and vision loss. Other corneal changes typical of keratoconus that can be seen during an eye exam include iron deposits in the cornea that form a yellow-to-brownish ring, called the Fleischer ring, surrounding the colored part of the eye (iris). Affected individuals may also develop Vogt's striae, which are thin, vertical, white lines in the tissue at the back of the cornea. Keratoconus may affect only one eye at first, but eventually the corneas of both eyes become misshapen, although they might not be affected with the same severity.

These vision problems may begin in one eye or simultaneously in both eyes; if vision loss starts in one eye, the other eye is usually affected within several weeks or months. Over time, vision in both eyes worsens with a severe loss of sharpness (visual acuity) and color vision. This condition mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.

The vision loss in these affected individuals resembles a category of retinal disorders called rod-cone dystrophies. The most common rod-cone dystrophy is called retinitis pigmentosa, and the vision problems in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome are sometimes referred to as such. However, the abnormal deposits of pigment in the retina from which retinitis pigmentosa gets its name are often not found in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome. As a result, some researchers use terms such as"atypical retinitis pigmentosa without pigment"to describe the retinal degeneration that occurs in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome.

difficult_to_pregnant: Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that often causes slowly worsening vision, usually beginning in childhood. People with optic atrophy type 1 typically experience a narrowing of their field of vision (tunnel vision). Affected individuals gradually lose their sight as their field of vision becomes smaller. Both eyes are usually affected equally, but the severity of the vision loss varies widely, even among affected members of the same family, ranging from nearly normal vision to complete blindness. In addition to vision loss, people with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision (color vision deficiency) that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green.In the early stages of the condition, individuals with optic atrophy type 1 experience a progressive loss of certain cells within the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The loss of these cells (known as retinal ganglion cells) is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that relay visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerves), which results in further vision loss. Atrophy causes these nerves to have an abnormally pale appearance (pallor), which can be seen during an eye examination.

Syndroms_correlate_with_infertility: Peters anomaly  https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/peters-anomaly
difficult_to_pregnant: Eye problems that occur in an area at the front part of the eye known as the anterior segment. The anterior segment consists of structures including the lens, the colored part (iris) of the eye, and the clear covering of the eye (cornea). During development of the eye, the elements of the anterior segment form separate structures. However, in Peters anomaly, development of the anterior segment is abnormal, leading to incomplete separation of the cornea from the iris or the lens. As a result, the cornea is cloudy (opaque), which causes blurred vision. The opaque area (opacity) of the cornea varies in size and intensity from a small, faint streak to a large, white cloudy area that covers the front surface of the eye. Additionally, the location of the opacity varies; the cloudiness may be at the center of the cornea or off-center. Large, centrally located opacities tend to cause poorer vision than smaller, off-center ones. Nearly half of the individuals affected with Peters anomaly have low vision early in life and about a quarter are legally blind. Due to a lack of visual stimulation, some individuals develop"lazy eye"(amblyopia). Peters anomaly is often associated with other eye problems, such as increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma), clouding of the lens (cataract), and unusually small eyeballs (microphthalmia). In most cases, Peters anomaly is bilateral, which means that it affects both eyes, although the level of vision impairment may be different in each eye. These individuals may have eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus). In some people with Peters anomaly, corneal clouding improves over time leading to improved vision.

Problems with night vision can make it difficult to navigate in low light. Later, the disease causes blind spots to develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots merge to produce tunnel vision. The disease progresses over years or decades to affect central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.

difficult_to_pregnant: Characterized by partial or total vision loss that worsens over time.The loss of vision is caused by an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts)

Syndroms_correlate_with_infertility: Wagner syndrome  https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/wagner-syndrome
difficult_to_pregnant: Progressive vision loss typically begin in childhood, although the vision impairment might not be immediately apparent.(the retina) becomes thin and may separate from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). The blood vessels within the retina (known as the choroid) may also be abnormal. The retina and the choroid progressively break down (degenerate). Some people with Wagner syndrome have blurred vision because of ectopic fovea, an abnormality in which the part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision is out of place. Additionally, the thick, clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous) becomes watery and thin. People with Wagner syndrome develop a clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract). Affected individuals may also experience nearsightedness (myopia), progressive night blindness, or a narrowing of their field of vision. Vision impairment in people with Wagner syndrome can vary from near normal vision to complete loss of vision in both eyes.
