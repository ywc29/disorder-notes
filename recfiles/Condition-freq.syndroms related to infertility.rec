Genes: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/breast-cancer Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. (Only  skin cancer is more common.) About one in eight women in the United States will  develop invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Researchers estimate that more  than 230,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in U.S. women  in 2015.Male breast cancer represents less than 1 percent of all breast cancer  diagnoses. Scientists estimate that about 2,300 new cases of breast cancer will  be diagnosed in men in 2015.Particular gene mutations associated with breast  cancer are more common among certain geographic or ethnic groups, such as people  of Ashkenazi (central or eastern European) Jewish heritage and people of  Norwegian, Icelandic, or Dutch ancestry.

This condition occurs much  more frequently in people of Asian ancestry, particularly in Japanese and  Southeast Asian populations.Although Brugada syndrome affects both men and  women, the condition appears to be 8 to 10 times more common in men.  Researchers suspect that testosterone, a sex hormone present at much higher  levels in men, may account for this difference.

Genes: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/buschke-ollendorff-syndrome Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome has an estimated incidence of 1 in 20,000  people worldwide.                               https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/c3-glomerulopathy C3 glomerulopathy is very rare, affecting 1 to 2 per million people  worldwide. It is equally common in men and women.                                                                                 https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/caffey-disease Caffey disease has been estimated to occur in approximately 3 per 1,000  infants worldwide. A few hundred cases have been described in the medical  literature. Researchers believe this condition is probably underdiagnosed  because it usually goes away by itself in early childhood.                                                             https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/campomelic-dysplasia The prevalence of campomelic dysplasia is uncertain; estimates range from 1  in 40,000 to 200,000 people.                                                                       https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/camurati-engelmann-disease The prevalence of Camurati-Engelmann disease is unknown. More than 300  cases have been reported worldwide.                                                       https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/canavan-disease While this condition occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds, it is most  common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage.  Studies suggest that this disorder affects 1 in 6,400 to 13,500 people in the  Ashkenazi Jewish population. The incidence in other populations is unknown.                                     https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cantu-syndrome Cantúsyndrome is a rare condition. About three dozen affected individuals  have been reported in the medical literature.                                                               https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cap-myopathy Cap myopathy is a rare disorder that has been identified in only a small  number of individuals.

Only a small  number of affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.  However, the disorder may be underdiagnosed because the metabolic crisis often  does not recur after the first episode; researchers suspect that some babies  diagnosed with transient hyperammonemia may actually have carbonic anhydrase VA  deficiency.                                               https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cardiofaciocutaneous-syndrome Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is a very rare condition whose incidence is  unknown.

The lethal neonatal form has been  described in at least 18 families, while the severe infantile  hepatocardiomuscular form has been identified in approximately 30 families. The  myopathic form occurs most frequently, with more than 300 reported cases.                                                             https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/carpenter-syndrome Carpenter syndrome is thought to be a rare condition; approximately 70  cases have been described in the scientific literature.                                                                                           https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia Cartilage-hair hypoplasia occurs most often in the Old Order Amish  population, where it affects about 1 in 1,300 newborns. In people of Finnish  descent, its incidence is approximately 1 in 20,000. Outside of these  populations, the condition is rare, and its specific incidence is not known. It  has been reported in individuals of European and Japanese descent.                                                                       https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cask-related-intellectual-disability The prevalence of CASK-related intellectual disability is unknown. More  than 50 females with MICPCH have been described in the medical literature, while  only a few affected males have been described.By contrast, more than 20 males  but only a few females have been diagnosed with the milder form of the disorder,  XL-ID with or without nystagmus. This form of the disorder may go unrecognized  in mildly affected females.                                                                         https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tach The prevalence of CPVT is estimated to be about 1 in 10,000 people. ycardia However, the true prevalence of this condition is unknown.                                 https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/catsper1-related-nonsyndromic-male-infertility The prevalence of CATSPER1-related nonsyndromic male infertility is  unknown.                 https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/caudal-regression-syndrome Caudal regression syndrome is estimated to occur in 1 to 2.5 per 100,000  newborns.

Estimates of its prevalence vary widely because several  other disorders, as well as other factors such as certain medications, can  result in similar tremors. In addition, mild cases are often not brought to  medical attention, or may not be detected in clinical exams that do not include  the particular circumstances in which an individual's tremor occurs. Severe  cases are often misdiagnosed as Parkinson disease.                                         https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ethylmalonic-encephalopathy About 70 individuals with this condition have been identified worldwide,  mostly in Mediterranean and Arab populations. Although ethylmalonic  encephalopathy appears to be very rare, researchers suggest that some cases have  been misdiagnosed as other neurological disorders.                     https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ewing-sarcoma Approximately 3 per 1 million children each year are diagnosed with a Ewing  sarcoma. It is estimated that, in the United States, 250 children are diagnosed  with one of these types of tumor each year. Ewing sarcoma accounts for about  1.5 percent of all childhood cancers, and it is the second most common type of  bone tumor in children (the most common type of bone cancer is called  osteosarcoma).                               https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/fabry-disease Fabry disease affects an estimated 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 males. This  disorder also occurs in females, although the prevalence is unknown. Milder,  late-onset forms of the disorder are probably more common than the classic,  severe form.                     https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/facioscapulohumeral-muscular-dystrophy Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has an estimated prevalence of 1 in  20,000 people. About 95 percent of all cases are FSHD1; the remaining 5 percent  are FSHD2.                                                                   https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-v-deficiency Factor V deficiency affects an estimated 1 in 1 million people.

Between  3 and 8 percent of people with European ancestry carry one copy of the factor V  Leiden mutation in each cell, and about 1 in 5,000 people have two copies of  the mutation. The mutation is less common in other populations.                                         https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-vii-deficiency Factor VII deficiency is estimated to affect 1 in 300,000 to 1 in 500,000  people. It is the most frequently occurring of a group of disorders classified  as rare bleeding disorders.                       https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-x-deficiency Factor X deficiency occurs in approximately 1 per million individuals  worldwide.                       https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-xi-deficiency Factor XI deficiency is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 1 million  people worldwide. The severe deficiency disorder is much more common in people  with central and eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry, occurring in  about 1 in 450 individuals in that population. Researchers suggest that the  actual prevalence of factor XI deficiency may be higher than reported, because  mild cases of the disorder often do not come to medical attention.                               https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-xiii-deficiency Inherited factor XIII deficiency affects 1 to 3 per million people  worldwide. Researchers suspect that mild factor XIII deficiency, including the  acquired form of the disorder, is underdiagnosed because many affected people  never have a major episode of abnormal bleeding that would lead to a diagnosis.                                 https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-acute-myeloid-leukemia-with-mutated-c Acute myeloid leukemia occurs in approximately 3.5 in 100,000 individuals ebpa per year.

However, researchers suspect  that the true incidence may be higher because some affected individuals have no  symptoms and are never diagnosed with the condition. Hereditary xanthinuria  appears to be more common in people of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ancestry.  About 150 cases of this condition have been reported in the medical literature.                                     https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a rare disorder in most populations and is  estimated to affect 1 in 500,000 to 1,000,000 individuals worldwide. Type 1 is  more common in Puerto Rico, particularly in the northwestern part of the island  where about 1 in 1,800 people are affected. Type 3 is common in people from  central Puerto Rico. Groups of affected individuals have been identified in many  other regions, including India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe.                                             https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/heterotaxy-syndrome The prevalence of heterotaxy syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 people  worldwide. However, researchers suspect that the condition is underdiagnosed,  and so it may actually be more common than this. Heterotaxy syndrome accounts  for approximately 3 percent of all congenital heart defects. For reasons that  are unknown, the condition appears to be more common in Asian populations than  in North America and Europe. Recent studies report that in the United States,  the condition occurs more frequently in children born to black or Hispanic  mothers than in children born to white mothers.                                                                                         https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hidradenitis-suppurativa Hidradenitis suppurativa was once thought to be a rare condition because  only the most severe cases were reported.

The exact prevalence is difficult to determine because many  of the signs and symptoms of SLE resemble those of other disorders. Diagnosis  may be delayed for years, and the condition may never be diagnosed in some  affected individuals. Females develop SLE about nine times more often than  males. It is most common in younger women, peaking during the childbearing  years; however, 20 percent of SLE cases occur in people over age 50.For unknown  reasons, in industrialized Western countries SLE has become 10 times more common  over the past 50 years. The prevalence of SLE in Africa and Asia is believed to  be much lower than in Western nations; however, in industrialized Western  countries, people of African and Asian descent are two to four times more likely  to develop SLE than are people of European descent. Researchers suggest that  factors such as ethnic mixing, tobacco use in industrialized countries, and the  different types of infections people acquire in different regions may contribute  to these differences. For example malaria, which occurs often in tropical  regions, is thought to be protective against SLE, while the Epstein-Barr virus,  more common in the West, increases SLE risk.                                                                                                                                                       https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/systemic-scleroderma The prevalence of systemic scleroderma is estimated to range from 50 to 300  cases per 1 million people.

By age 18, approximately 1 in 300 people in the United States  develop type 1 diabetes. The disorder occurs with similar frequencies in Europe,  the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand. Type 1 diabetes occurs much less  frequently in Asia and South America, with reported incidences as low as 1 in 1  million per year. For unknown reasons, during the past 20 years the worldwide  incidence of type 1 diabetes has been increasing by 2 to 5 percent each  year.Type 1 diabetes accounts for 5 to 10 percent of cases of diabetes  worldwide. Most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, in which the body  continues to produce insulin but becomes less able to use it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/type-2-diabetes Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, accounting for 90 to  95 percent of all cases. In 2015, more than 23 million people in the United  States had diagnosed diabetes and an additional 7 million people likely had  undiagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, and the  disease currently affects more than 20 percent of Americans over age 65. It is  the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.The risk of diabetes  varies by ethnic and geographic background. In the United States, the disease is  most common in Native Americans and Alaska Natives. It also has a higher  prevalence among people of African American or Hispanic ancestry than those of  non-Hispanic white or Asian ancestry. Geographically, diabetes is most prevalent  in the southern and Appalachian regions of the United States.The prevalence of  diabetes is rapidly increasing worldwide. Due to an increase in inactive  (sedentary) lifestyles, obesity, and other risk factors, the frequency of this  disease has more than quadrupled in the past 35 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/type-a-insulin-resistance-syndrome Type A insulin resistance syndrome is estimated to affect about 1 in  100,000 people worldwide.

# NOTE: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgenetic-alopecia
Genes: hair loss
Male_or_female: a common form of hair loss in both men and women. In men, this condition is also known as male-pattern baldness. Hair is lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Over time, the hairline recedes to form a characteristic"M"shape. Hair also thins at the crown (near the top of the head), often progressing to partial or complete baldness.The pattern of hair loss in women differs from male-pattern baldness. In women, the hair becomes thinner all over the head, and the hairline does not recede. Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness.Androgenetic alopecia in men has been associated with several other medical conditions including coronary heart disease and enlargement of the prostate. Additionally, prostate cancer, disorders of insulin resistance (such as diabetes and obesity), and high blood pressure (hypertension) have been related to androgenetic alopecia. In women, this form of hair loss is associated with an increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by a hormonal imbalance that can lead to irregular menstruation, acne, excess hair elsewhere on the body (hirsutism), and weight gain.

These networks, visualized by a particular test called an angiogram, resemble puffs of smoke, which is how the condition got its name:"moyamoya"is an expression meaning"something hazy like a puff of smoke"in Japanese.

Male_or_female: Characterized by an increased number of red blood cells in the bloodstream. Affected individuals may also have excess white blood cells and blood clotting cell fragments called platelets. These extra cells and platelets cause the blood to be thicker than normal. As a result, abnormal blood clots are more likely to form and block the flow of blood through arteries and veins. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of heart attack and stroke caused by blood clots in the heart and brain.

Male_or_female: Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy in which affected women develop high blood pressure (hypertension); they can also have abnormally high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). This condition usually occurs in the last few months of pregnancy and often requires early delivery of the infant.In severe cases, however, preeclampsia can damage the mother's organs, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, and can lead to life-threatening complications. Extremely high blood pressure in the mother can cause bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Women who have had preeclampsia have approximately twice the lifetime risk of heart disease and stroke than do women in the general population.

People with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors; they see only black, white, and shades of gray. Incomplete achromatopsia is a milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination. Achromatopsia also involves other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity). Affected individuals can also have farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less commonly, nearsightedness (myopia). These vision problems develop in the first few months of life.

Genes: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration
Male_or_female: A leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time. Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.

# NOTE: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bradyopsia
Male_or_female: the eyes adapt more slowly than usual to changing light conditions. For example, people with this condition are blinded for several seconds when going from a dark environment into a bright one, such as when walking out of a darkened movie theater into daylight. Their eyes also have trouble adapting from bright light to dark conditions, such as when driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day. Some people with bradyopsia also have difficulty seeing some moving objects, particularly small objects moving against a bright background. As a result, they often have trouble watching or participating in sports with a ball, such as soccer or tennis. People with bradyopsia can have reduced sharpness (acuity) of vision, although acuity may depend on the conditions under which vision is tested. Visual acuity may appear to be severely affected if it is tested under bright lights, but it can be near normal if tested in a dim environment. The ability to see colors and distinguish between them is normal.

These two forms of color vision deficiency disrupt color perception but do not affect the sharpness of vision (visual acuity). A less common and more severe form of color vision deficiency called blue cone monochromacy causes very poor visual acuity and severely reduced color vision. Affected individuals have additional vision problems, which can include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and nearsightedness (myopia).

Male_or_female: An eye condition that affects the shape of the cornea, which is the clear outer covering of the eye. In this condition, the cornea thins and bulges outward, eventually resembling a cone shape. These corneal abnormalities, which worsen over time, can lead to nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision that cannot be improved with corrective lenses (irregular astigmatism), and vision loss. Other corneal changes typical of keratoconus that can be seen during an eye exam include iron deposits in the cornea that form a yellow-to-brownish ring, called the Fleischer ring, surrounding the colored part of the eye (iris). Affected individuals may also develop Vogt's striae, which are thin, vertical, white lines in the tissue at the back of the cornea. Keratoconus may affect only one eye at first, but eventually the corneas of both eyes become misshapen, although they might not be affected with the same severity. As keratoconus worsens, people with this condition can develop corneal scarring, often caused by exposure of the abnormally thin cornea to prolonged contact lens use or excessive eye rubbing.

Male_or_female: An inherited form of vision loss. This condition usually begins in a person's teens or twenties, rare cases may appear in early childhood or later in adulthood. For unknown reasons, males are affected much more often than females. Blurring and clouding of vision are usually the first symptoms of LHON. These vision problems may begin in one eye or simultaneously in both eyes; if vision loss starts in one eye, the other eye is usually affected within several weeks or months. Over time, vision in both eyes worsens with a severe loss of sharpness (visual acuity) and color vision. This condition mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. Vision loss results from the death of cells in the nerve that relays visual information from the eyes to the brain (the optic nerve). Although central vision gradually improves in a small percentage of cases, in most cases the vision loss is profound and permanent.

Degeneration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) almost always occurs in this disorder, but the age at which this feature develops varies. Some affected individuals are blind or have severe vision impairment beginning in infancy, with the pattern of vision loss resembling a condition called Leber congenital amaurosis. In other people with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, the retinal degeneration begins in childhood, but some vision is retained into early adulthood. The vision loss in these affected individuals resembles a category of retinal disorders called rod-cone dystrophies. The most common rod-cone dystrophy is called retinitis pigmentosa, and the vision problems in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome are sometimes referred to as such. However, the abnormal deposits of pigment in the retina from which retinitis pigmentosa gets its name are often not found in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome. As a result, some researchers use terms such as"atypical retinitis pigmentosa without pigment"to describe the retinal degeneration that occurs in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome.

Male_or_female: Mucolipidosis type IV is an inherited disorder characterized by delayed development and vision impairment that worsens over time. Vision may be normal at birth in people with typical mucolipidosis type IV, but it becomes increasingly impaired during the first decade of life. Individuals with this condition develop clouding of the clear covering of the eye (cornea) and progressive breakdown of the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (retina). By their early teens, affected individuals have severe vision loss or blindness.

Male_or_female: Norrie disease is an inherited eye disorder that leads to blindness in male infants at birth or soon after birth. It causes abnormal development of the retina, the layer of sensory cells that detect light and color, with masses of immature retinal cells accumulating at the back of the eye. As a result, the pupils appear white when light is shone on them, a sign called leukocoria. The irises (colored portions of the eyes) or the entire eyeballs may shrink and deteriorate during the first months of life, and cataracts (cloudiness in the lens of the eye) may eventually develop.

Male_or_female: Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that often causes slowly worsening vision, usually beginning in childhood. People with optic atrophy type 1 typically experience a narrowing of their field of vision (tunnel vision). Affected individuals gradually lose their sight as their field of vision becomes smaller. Both eyes are usually affected equally, but the severity of the vision loss varies widely, even among affected members of the same family, ranging from nearly normal vision to complete blindness. In addition to vision loss, people with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision (color vision deficiency) that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green.In the early stages of the condition, individuals with optic atrophy type 1 experience a progressive loss of certain cells within the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The loss of these cells (known as retinal ganglion cells) is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that relay visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerves), which results in further vision loss. Atrophy causes these nerves to have an abnormally pale appearance (pallor), which can be seen during an eye examination.

Genes: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/peters-anomaly
Male_or_female: Eye problems that occur in an area at the front part of the eye known as the anterior segment. The anterior segment consists of structures including the lens, the colored part (iris) of the eye, and the clear covering of the eye (cornea). During development of the eye, the elements of the anterior segment form separate structures. However, in Peters anomaly, development of the anterior segment is abnormal, leading to incomplete separation of the cornea from the iris or the lens. As a result, the cornea is cloudy (opaque), which causes blurred vision. The opaque area (opacity) of the cornea varies in size and intensity from a small, faint streak to a large, white cloudy area that covers the front surface of the eye. Additionally, the location of the opacity varies; the cloudiness may be at the center of the cornea or off-center. Large, centrally located opacities tend to cause poorer vision than smaller, off-center ones. Nearly half of the individuals affected with Peters anomaly have low vision early in life and about a quarter are legally blind. Due to a lack of visual stimulation, some individuals develop"lazy eye"(amblyopia). Peters anomaly is often associated with other eye problems, such as increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma), clouding of the lens (cataract), and unusually small eyeballs (microphthalmia). In most cases, Peters anomaly is bilateral, which means that it affects both eyes, although the level of vision impairment may be different in each eye. These individuals may have eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus). In some people with Peters anomaly, corneal clouding improves over time leading to improved vision.

Male_or_female: A group of related eye disorders that cause progressive vision loss. In people with retinitis pigmentosa, vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate.The first sign of retinitis pigmentosa is usually a loss of night vision, which becomes apparent in childhood. Problems with night vision can make it difficult to navigate in low light. Later, the disease causes blind spots to develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots merge to produce tunnel vision. The disease progresses over years or decades to affect central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. In adulthood, many people with retinitis pigmentosa become legally blind.

Genes: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/weill-marchesani-syndrome
Male_or_female: An eye abnormality called microspherophakia is characteristic of Weill-Marchesani syndrome. This term refers to a small, sphere-shaped lens, which is associated with nearsightedness (myopia) that worsens over time. The lens also may be positioned abnormally within the eye (ectopia lentis). Many people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome develop glaucoma, an eye disease that increases the pressure in the eye and can lead to blindness.

Genes: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/wolfram-syndrome
Male_or_female: The hallmark features of Wolfram syndrome are high blood sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin (diabetes mellitus) and progressive vision loss due to degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). Optic atrophy is often the next symptom to appear, usually around age 11. The first signs of optic atrophy are loss of color vision and side (peripheral) vision. Over time, the vision problems get worse, and people with optic atrophy are usually blind within approximately 8 years after signs of optic atrophy first begin.

Male_or_female: A disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness). They also have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder.

# NOTE: Name
Genes: Most affected males have a form of HSD10 disease in which early development seems normal, followed by a stage in which affected individuals rapidly lose skills they have acquired. This developmental regression often occurs between the ages of 1 and 2 and results in severe intellectual disability and loss of communication skills and motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. This form of the disorder is referred to as the infantile type. Less commonly, affected males have severe neurological problems from birth and never develop motor skills. This form is called the neonatal type. GHR-webpage frequency
