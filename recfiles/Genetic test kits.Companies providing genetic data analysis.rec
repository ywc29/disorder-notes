RecordType_Descr: Companies providing genetic data analysis
Name: * Depends largely how the library is prepared. Library preparation is a critical step in the WGS workflow.  DNA is first fragmented to the appropriate size, after which platform-specific adapters are added. PCR-free workflows are preferred for WGS, but in cases where input DNA is limited or is of poor quality, library amplification has to be performed. WGS library construction protocols typically include a size-selection step as libraries with a narrow fragment distribution are generally preferred. After sequencing, the sequence reads are aligned against a reference genome (reference-guided sequence assembly), or when no such reference is available, compared to each other and assembled into long contiguous segments (de novo sequencing).
