Products: Oncofocus®Test
Technology_used: next generation sequencing (NGS) by Semiconductor sequencing
Sample: works by firstly sequencing the DNA and RNA of a patient’s tumour which has been extracted from the routine histology sample used for diagnosis.
# NOTE: works by firstly sequencing the DNA and RNA of a patient’s tumour which has been extracted from the routine histology sample used for diagnosis.
Aim: New Precision Oncology Cancer Test to identify the most effective anti cancer-treatment,
Location: Chesterford Research Park, Cambridge, UK
Remarks: Oncofocus®currently targets 505 genes covering  oncogenes, fusion genes, genes susceptible to copy number variation and tumour suppressors. The Test also includes analysis of tumour mutational burden (TMB) which specifically predicts response to immunotherapy. Actionable genetic variants detected by Oncofocus®are currently linked to 717 anti-cancer targeted therapies/therapy combinations. Targeted actionable hotspots include SNVs, indels, CNVs and gene fusions. Notably these driver cancer genes have been selected because they are the most clinically relevant and have been approved for reimbursement in the US.

Website: https://livewello.com/genetics
Products: Work with raw data from several direct-to-consumer genetic services. LiveWello can process genetic raw data from: 23andMe.com, Ancestry.com (Autosomal DNA), Family Tree DNA (Autosomal DNA), Gene By Gene
Technology_used: a one time fee of $19.95
Sample: LiveWello's Genetic tools will give you reports for 600,000 SNPs, AND attach 12 resources for learning about each gene. As long as a SNP has an rsID and Minor Allele, LiveWello will generate a gene report for you. The reason for this feature is that people should really have all the information about ALL the genes in their raw data not just some of them. That way, you and your Health Practitioner can have the benefit of all this information when creating your treatment plan.
