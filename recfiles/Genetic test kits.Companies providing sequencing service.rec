Service_provides: Ancestry service (79GBP) Health + Ancestry service (149 GBP) (can review the DNA result regularly, for genetic traits info and health risk) (remarks: raw data feature is suitably only for informational use and not for medical, diagnostic or other use. Consult with a healthcare professional before making any major changes in lifestyle) (The test does not cover the variants that maybe more common in people of Asian descent)All saliva samples are processed in labs in the United States that meet local regulations. Once participants answer online survey questions, researchers link their genetic data to study topics from ancestry, to traits, to disease. These contributions help drive scientific discoveries. The choice to opt into or out of research is always up to the participant. 23andMe is the first and only genetic service available directly to consumers that includes reports that meet FDA standards.

Service_provides: Noninvasive prenatal test (PINT) that screens for multiple fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. Directly analyzes cell-free fetal and maternal DNA; High detection rate. Test as early as 10 weeks gestational age (8 weeks of fetal age as determined by date of conception) with no limitations regarding ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), assisted reproductive technology (ART), or egg donor cases. *Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a screening test. Results should be confirmed by diagnostic testing prior to making any pregnancy management decisions.

Company_name: MGZ Medical Genetics Center.
Service_provides: 90% of the samples MGZ analyzes with the CytoSNP-850K BeadChip are postnatal. These analyses help identify the causes of autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability (ID), dysmorphic features, or neurological disorders such as epilepsy. MGZ also performs prenatal analysis with conventional karyotyping, chromosomal microarrays, and noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for chromosomal aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). Uses the MiSeq and NextSeq®500 Systems to run a large number of custom panels to identify variants associated with rare hereditary diseases and the TruSight Cancer Sequencing Panel, which targets 94 genes with suspected associations to common and rare cancers. The sequencing panel also includes 284 SNPs suspected to correlate with cancer through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).The TruSight Cancer Sequencing Panel is a test method that anyonecan adapt easily in their laboratory,”Dr. Benet-Pagès said.“It’s easy to implement in automated workflows and performs with high repeatability and reproducibility. The TruSight Cancer Panel enables us to analyze more genes in a single workflow than previous technologies. The advantage is that we can identify potential mutations in cancer associated genes not primarily tested.

Country: * Depends largely how the library is prepared. Library preparation is a critical step in the WGS workflow.  DNA is first fragmented to the appropriate size, after which platform-specific adapters are added. PCR-free workflows are preferred for WGS, but in cases where input DNA is limited or is of poor quality, library amplification has to be performed. WGS library construction protocols typically include a size-selection step as libraries with a narrow fragment distribution are generally preferred. After sequencing, the sequence reads are aligned against a reference genome (reference-guided sequence assembly), or when no such reference is available, compared to each other and assembled into long contiguous segments (de novo sequencing).
