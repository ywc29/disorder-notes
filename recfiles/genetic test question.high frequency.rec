Name: 16p11.2 duplication
website: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/16p112-duplication
frequency: 16p11.2 duplications have been estimated to occur in about 3 in 10,000 people. These changes are present in about 4 in 10,000 people who have mental health problems or difficulties with speech and language. Many people with the duplication are likely never diagnosed because there are many causes of these problems, and some people with the duplication have no related health or developmental problems.

frequency: Researchers estimate that about 1 in 2,000 newborns have a 16p12.2 microdeletion and show signs and symptoms of the condition. However, the actual number may be higher because many people with the microdeletion are likely never diagnosed. Some never come to medical attention because they have no related health or behavioral problems or have only mild signs and symptoms. Others have nonspecific features for which there can be many causes.

website: M/F/don’t know 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency is a condition that affects male sexual development. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome in each cell, and they have male gonads (testes). Most people with 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency are born with external genitalia that appear female. Men with this disorder are generally unable to father children (infertile).

website: 親屬出現早發性乳癌（四十五歲或以下發病） 一般大腸癌在60、70歲出現，若在30、40歲病發的個案便比較「唔正常」，尤其是近親家族中不止一宗病例，更要小心，有可能是遺傳基因導致疾病一代傳一代。 遺傳性大腸癌在臨牀上並不少見，而乳腺癌同樣有遺傳情况，一旦發現有此情况，可採取一系列預防措施，如更早或更頻密檢查，及早發現和治療病變，並透過計劃生育早作預防。 很多人以為一出生便出現的先天性疾病，才是遺傳病，其實不然，人類的疾病不少都是從遺傳得來，再加上後天的誘發因素而發病。每個人都是由精子與卵子結合成胎兒，所以父母的基因在胚胎形成時已經遺傳下來，包括變異的基因，若在胎兒出生前已經引起病變便是先天性疾病，到嬰兒出生後才出現便是後天性疾病，但也與遺傳基因有關，最常見由基因引發的後天疾病就是癌症。心血管疾病及糖尿病亦是遺傳基因和後天環境因素配合而病發。因此，現在學者希望從遺傳基因着手，目的是達到防病的效果。他指出，若家族有相關病史，成員的患病率會相對較高，建議及早改善生活習慣，以減低發病風險。 孩子患遺傳性疾病 多名成員患乳癌（最少兩名） 患上卵巢癌，家族有患乳癌及/或卵巢癌病史 本身有乳癌、卵巢癌或輸卵管癌病史，特別是高分化漿液性腺癌和絕經前卵巢和輸卵管癌
